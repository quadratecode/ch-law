## (Consultation Procedure Act, CPA)

of 18 March 2005 (Status as of 26 November 2018)

The Federal Assembly of the Swiss Confederation,

based on Article 147 of the Federal Constitution,  
and having considered the Federal Council Dispatch of 21 January 2004,

decrees:

[**Art. 1** Scope of application](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/542/en#art_1) 

[1] This Act regulates the main aspects of the consultation procedure.

[2] It applies to consultation procedures that are initiated by the Federal Council, a department, the Federal Chancellery or a parliamentary committee.

[**Art. 2** Purpose of the consultation procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/542/en#art_2) 

[1] The consultation procedure has the aim of allowing the cantons, political parties and interested groups to participate in the shaping of opinion and the decision-making process of the Confederation.

[2] It is intended to provide information on material accuracy, feasibility of implementation and public acceptance of a federal project.

[**Art. 3**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/542/en#art_3) [Subject matter of the consultation procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/542/en#art_3) 

[1] A consultation procedure takes place when drafting:


|    a. amendments to the Constitution;  
|    b. draft legislation in terms of Article 164 paragraph 1 of the Federal Constitution;  
|    c. international law agreements that are subject to a referendum in terms of Articles 140 paragraph 1 letter b and 141 paragraph 1 letter d number 3 of the Federal Constitution or which affect essential cantonal interests;  
|    d. ordinances and other projects of major political, financial, economic, ecological, social or cultural significance;  
|    e. ordinances and other projects that do not fall within letter d but which significantly affect individual cantons or all the cantons or are implemented to a significant extent outside the Federal Administration.

[2] A consultation procedure may also be carried out in projects that do not meet any of the requirements in paragraph 1.

[**Art. 3***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/542/en#art_3_a) [Dispensing with a consultation procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/542/en#art_3_a) 

[1] A consultation procedure may be dispensed with if:


|    a. the project relates primarily to the organisation or procedures of federal authorities or to the allocation of responsibilities among federal authorities; or  
|    b. no new findings are expected because the positions of the interested groups are known, in particular because a consultation procedure on the subject matter of the project has already been carried out.

[2] Well-founded justification must be provided for a decision to dispense with a consultation procedure.

[**Art. 4** Participation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/542/en#art_4) 

[1] Anyone and any organisation may participate in a consultation procedure and submit an opinion.

[2] The following are invited to submit an opinion:


|    a. the cantonal governments;  
|    b. the political parties represented in the Federal Assembly;  
|    c. the national umbrella organisations for the communes, cities and mountain regions;   
|    d. the national umbrella organisations for the economic sector;  
|    e. the extra-parliamentary committees and any further interest groups relevant to the individual case.

[3] The Federal Chancellery maintains a list of parties consulted in terms of paragraph 2 letters a–d.

|    c. by the responsible unit of the central or decentralised Federal Administration if it is authorised to enact legislation.

[2] Consultation procedures on projects from the Federal Assembly are initiated by the responsible parliamentary committee.

[3] The Federal Chancellery coordinates the consultation procedures. It gives public notice of any consultation procedure that has been initiated, providing details of the consultation period and the office where the consultation documents may be obtained.
