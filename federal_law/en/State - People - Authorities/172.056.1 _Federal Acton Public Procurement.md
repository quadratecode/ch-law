[1] The following are subject to this Act as contracting authorities:

|    h. the exploitation of a geographical area for the purpose of exploring for or extracting oil, gas, coal or other solid fuels.

[3] The contracting authorities under paragraph 2 are subject to this Act only in the case of procurements for the area of activity described, but not for their other activities.

[4] If a third party awards a public contract on behalf of one or more contracting authorities, this third party is subject to this Act in the same way as the contracting authority it represents.

[**Art. 5** Applicable law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_5) 

[1] If several contracting authorities subject to federal and cantonal law participate in a procurement, the law of the community whose contracting authority provides the most financing applies. If the total cantonal share outweighs the federal share, this Act does not apply.

[2] Several contracting authorities involved in a procurement may, by mutual agreement, make a joint procurement subject to the law of one of the contracting authorities involved, in derogation from the above principles.

[3] Public and private undertakings that have been granted exclusive or special rights by the Confederation or that perform tasks in the national interest may choose whether to subject their procurements to the law of their place of business or to federal law.

[**Art. 6** Tenderers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_6) 

[1] Under this Act, tenderers from Switzerland are permitted to submit a tender, as are tenderers from countries with which Switzerland has undertaken to grant market access on a contractual basis, provided such countries have undertaken the same commitment to Switzerland.

[2] Outside the scope of international treaties, foreign tenderers are permitted to submit a tender if their countries of origin grant reciprocal rights or if the contracting authority so permits.

[3] The Federal Council shall keep a list of the countries that have undertaken to grant market access to Switzerland. The list shall be updated periodically.

[**Art. 7** Exemption from subjection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_7) 

[1] If there is effective competition in the market for a sector under Article 4 paragraph 2, the Federal Council, acting on a proposal from a contracting authority or the Intercantonal Public Procurement Body (InöB), shall issue an ordinance exempting procurements in this market from being subject to this Act in whole or in part. 

[2] Before issuing its ordinance, the Federal Council shall consult the Competition Commission, the Intercantonal Public Procurement Body and the business circles concerned. The Competition Commission may publish its expert opinion, provided it pays due regard to commercial secrecy.

## [Section 2 Objective Scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#chap_2/sec_2)

[**Art. 8** Public contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_8) 

[1] A public contract is a contract that is entered into by the contracting authority and the tenderer for the performance of a public task. It involves the payment of money in return for the supply of goods, work or services, with these characteristic supplies being provided by the tenderer.

[2] A distinction is made between the following supplies:


|    a. construction work;  
|    b. supplies of goods;   
|    c. services.

[3] Mixed contracts comprise various supplies in accordance with paragraph 2 and form an overall transaction. The overall transaction is categorised based on the financially predominant supply. Supplies may not be mixed or bundled with the intention or effect of circumventing the provisions of this Act.

[4] Within the scope of international treaties, supplies in accordance with Annexes 1 to 3 are subject to this Act if they reach the threshold values in section 1 of Annex 4.

[5] Public contracts outside the scope of international treaties and the special provisions applicable thereto are listed in Annex 5.

[**Art. 9** Delegation of public tasks and granting of concessions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_9) 

The delegation of a public task or the granting of a concession is deemed to be a public contract if it gives the tenderer exclusive or special rights which the tenderer exercises in the public interest and for which the tenderer receives remuneration or compensation directly or indirectly. The provisions of special legislation remain reserved.

[**Art. 10** Exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_10) 

[1] This Act does not apply to:


|    a. the procurement of goods, work and services with a view to commercial sale or resale, or with a view to use in the production or supply of goods, work and services for commercial sale or resale;  
|    b. the acquisition, rental or leasing of land, buildings and installations, and the corresponding rights thereto;  
|    c. the granting of financial assistance in accordance with the Federal Act of 5 October 1990 on Financial Assistance and Subsidies;  
|    d. contracts for financial services relating to the issuance, purchase, sale, transfer or management of securities or other financial instruments and central bank services;  
|    e. contracts with institutions for the disabled, work integration organisations, charities and penal institutions;  
|    f. contracts under personnel law;  
|    g. the following legal services:  
|    1. representation of the Confederation or a federal public corporation by a lawyer in national or international arbitration, conciliation or court proceedings and associated services,  
|    2. legal advice from a lawyer with regard to possible proceedings under number 1 if there is a high probability that the matter to which the advice relates will become the subject of such proceedings;


|    h. procurements:  
|    1. within the framework of international humanitarian emergency assistance and agricultural and nutritional support,   
|    2. in accordance with the specific procedures or conditions set out in an international agreement regarding the stationing of troops or the joint implementation of a project by signatory states,  
|    3. carried out in accordance with the specific procedures or conditions of an international organisation or co-financed by international financial assistance, loans or other forms of assistance if the procedures or conditions applicable would be incompatible with this Act,   
|    4. within the framework of international cooperation, provided that an equivalent local procedure is followed in the recipient state;


|    i. public pension funds of the Confederation.

[2] The contracting authority has to prepare documentation on each contract awarded in accordance with paragraph 1 letter h.

[3] In addition, this Act does not apply to the procurement of goods, work or services:


|    a. from tenderers that have an exclusive right to provide such goods, work or services;  
|    b. from other, legally independent contracting authorities which are themselves subject to procurement law, provided that these contracting authorities do not provide these goods, work and services in competition with private tenderers;  
|    c. from dependent organisational units of the contracting authority;  
|    d. from tenderers over which the contracting authority exercises control identical to the control over its own units, insofar as these tenderers provide their goods, work or services for the most part for the contracting authority.

[4] Furthermore, this Act does not apply to public contracts:


|    a. if this is deemed necessary for the protection and maintenance of external or internal security or public order;  
|    b. insofar as this is necessary for the protection of human health or life, or of flora and fauna;  
|    c. insofar as tendering would infringe intellectual property rights.

# [Chapter 3 General Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#chap_3)

[**Art. 11** Procedural principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_11) 

When awarding public contracts, the contracting authority shall observe the following procedural principles:


|    a. It shall carry out award procedures transparently, objectively and impartially.  
|    b. It shall take measures against conflicts of interest, unlawful agreements affecting competition and against corruption.  
|    c. It shall ensure equal treatment of tenderers at all stages of the procedure.  
|    d. It shall dispense with bidding rounds.  
|    e. It shall safeguard the confidential nature of the information provided by tenderers.

[**Art. 12**  Compliance with workplace health and safety regulations, terms and conditions of employment, equal pay for men and women, and environmental law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_12) 

[1] For goods, work and services to be provided in Switzerland, the contracting authority shall award a public contract only to tenderers that comply with the workplace health and safety regulations and the terms and conditions of employment applicable at the place of performance, the notification and authorisation duties in accordance with the Federal Act of 17 June 2005 on Measures to Combat Illegal Employment (IEA) and the provisions on the equal treatment of men and women in terms of equal pay.

[2] For goods, work and services to be provided abroad, the contracting authority shall award a public contract only to tenderers that comply as a minimum with the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in accordance with Annex 6. In addition, the contracting authority may require compliance with other important international labour standards, as well as appropriate evidence, and may arrange for checks to be carried out.

[3] The contracting authority shall award a public contract only to tenderers that comply as a minimum with the legal provisions on the protection of the environment and the conservation of natural resources applicable at the place of performance; in Switzerland, these include the provisions of Swiss environmental law, and abroad the international conventions for the protection of the environment designated by the Federal Council.

[4] Subcontractors are obliged to comply with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3. These obligations must be included in the agreements between tenderers and subcontractors.

[5] The contracting authority may check compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 or outsource the task, provided this task was not delegated to an authority governed by special legislation or another suitable body, in particular a supervisory body with equal representation. The contracting authority may provide the authority or supervisory body with the necessary information and documents for carrying out these checks. The tenderer has to provide the evidence required upon request.

[6] The authorities and supervisory bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 report to the contracting authority on the results of the checks and on any measures taken.

[**Art. 13** Recusal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_13) 

[1] Persons may not participate in the award procedure on the contracting authority's behalf or in a panel of experts if they: 


|    a. have a personal interest in a contract;  
|    b. are connected to a tenderer or a member of one of its governing bodies by marriage or registered partnership, or cohabit de facto with this party;  
|    c. are related to a tenderer or a member of one of its governing bodies by blood or by marriage in a direct line or collaterally to the third degree;  
|    d. are representatives of a tenderer or worked for a tenderer on the same matter; or  
|    e. lack the independence necessary to carry out public procurements for other reasons.

[2] A recusal request must be submitted immediately after the reason for recusal becomes known.

[3] Decisions on recusal requests are made by the contracting authority or the panel of experts, excluding the person concerned.

[**Art. 14**  Prior involvement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_14) 

[1] Tenderers that were involved in the preparation of an award procedure are not permitted to submit a tender if the competitive advantage that they gain cannot be offset by appropriate means and if the exclusion does not jeopardise effective competition between tenderers.

[2] Appropriate means of offsetting the competitive advantage include in particular:


|    a. the disclosure of all material information about the preparatory work;  
|    b. the disclosure of the parties involved in the preparatory work;  
|    c. the extension of minimum deadlines.

[3] Any market clarification by the contracting authority prior to the public invitation to tender does not lead to prior involvement of the tenderers in question. The contracting authority discloses the results of the market clarification in the tender documentation.

[**Art. 15** Determining the value of the contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_15) 

[1] The contracting authority shall estimate the probable value of the contract. 

[2] A public contract may not be split up in order to circumvent provisions of this Act.

[3] When estimating the value of the contract, all of the goods, work and services to be put out to tender, as well as remuneration that is closely related materially or legally, must be taken into account. All remuneration components must be taken into account, including extension options and options for subsequent contracts, as well as all expected premiums, fees, commissions and interest, excluding value added tax. 

[4] In the case of fixed-term contracts, the contract value is calculated on the basis of the total remuneration over the entire term, including any extension options. As a rule, the fixed term may not exceed 5 years. A longer term may be envisaged in justified cases.

[5] For open-ended contracts, the contract value is calculated by multiplying the monthly remuneration by 48.

[6] In the case of contracts for goods, work or services required on a recurring basis, the contract value is calculated on the basis of the remuneration paid for such goods, work or services during the last 12 months or, in the case of an initial contract, on the basis of the estimated requirements over the next 12 months.

# [Chapter 4 Award Procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#chap_4)

[**Art. 16** Thresholds](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_16) 

[1] The choice of procedure depends on the value of the contract and the thresholds in accordance with Annex 4. The Federal Council periodically adjusts the thresholds in line with international obligations after consulting the Intercantonal Public Procurement Body.

[2] The Confederation guarantees the participation of the cantons in any adjustment of international obligations with regard to the thresholds. 

[3] If several contracting authorities subject to this Act, each with different thresholds, participate in a procurement, the thresholds of the contracting authority that provides the most financing apply to the entire procurement.

[4] If the total value of several construction work items listed in section 1 of Annex 1 for the realisation of a structure reaches the threshold for the scope of international treaties, the provisions of this Act that govern procurements within the scope of international treaties apply. However, if the value of each individual construction work item is less than CHF 2 million and the total value of these items does not exceed 20% of the structure's total value, they are subject to the provisions for procurements outside the scope of international treaties (*de minimis* clause). 

[5] The applicable procedure for construction work outside the scope of international treaties is determined on the basis of the value of the individual construction work items.

[**Art. 17** Procedure types](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_17) 

Depending on the value of the contract and the thresholds, the contracting authority may choose to award public contracts by open procedure, selective procedure, invitation procedure or direct award procedure.

[**Art. 18** Open procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_18) 

[1] In the open procedure, the contracting authority issues a public invitation tender.

[2] All tenderers may submit a tender.

[**Art. 19** Selective procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_19) 

[1] In the selective procedure, the contracting authority issues a public invitation to tender and invites the tenderers to submit a request to participate first.

[2] The contracting authority selects the tenderers that may submit a tender based on their eligibility. 

[3] The contracting authority may limit the number of tenderers permitted to tender, provided that effective competition is maintained. If possible, at least three tenderers are permitted to submit tenders.

[**Art. 20** Invitation procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_20) 

[1] The invitation procedure applies to public contracts outside the scope of international treaties in accordance with the thresholds in Annex 4.

[2] In the invitation procedure, the contracting authority invites the tenderers of its choice to submit tenders without launching a public invitation to tender. It prepares tender documentation for this purpose. If possible, at least three tenders are obtained.

[3] An invitation procedure without observing the thresholds may be used for the procurement of weapons, ammunition, war material and, provided they are essential for defence and security purposes, other supplies of goods, construction work, services and research or development services.

[**Art. 21** Direct award procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_21) 

[1] In the direct award procedure, the contracting authority awards a public contract directly without an invitation to tender. The contracting authority is entitled to obtain comparative quotes and to conduct negotiations.

[2] The contracting authority may award a contract using the direct award procedure irrespective of the threshold value if one of the following conditions is met:


|    a. In the open, selective or invitation procedure, no tenders or requests to participate are received, no tender meets the essential requirements of the tender or the technical specifications, or no tenderer meets the eligibility criteria.  
|    b. There are sufficient indications that all of the tenders received in the open, selective or invitation procedure are based on unlawful agreements affecting competition.  
|    c. Due to the technical or artistic features of the contract or for reasons of intellectual property protection, only one tenderer is eligible and there is no appropriate alternative.  
|    d. Due to unforeseeable events, procurement becomes so urgent that, even with shortened deadlines, an open, selective or invitation procedure cannot be carried out.  
|    e. A change of tenderer for goods, work or services to replace, supplement or extend supplies already provided is not possible for economic or technical reasons, would cause considerable difficulties or would entail substantial additional costs.  
|    f. The contracting authority is procuring original products (prototypes) or new types of supplies which are produced or developed at its request as part of a research, trial, study or new development contract.  
|    g. The contracting authority is procuring supplies on commodity exchanges.  
|    h. The contracting authority can procure supplies at a price significantly lower than the customary prices due to a favourable, temporary offer (particularly in the case of liquidation sales).  
|    i. The contracting authority is awarding the follow-up contract to the winner of a planning or turnkey contract competition or of a selection procedure for planning or turnkey contract studies; the following conditions must be met:  
|    1. the preceding procedure was conducted in compliance with the principles of the law;  
|    2. the proposed solutions were assessed by an independent panel of experts;  
|    3. the contracting authority reserved the right in the invitation to tender to award the subsequent contract in a direct award procedure.



[3] The contracting authority may use the direct award procedure to award a contract as described in Article 20 paragraph 3 if the direct award procedure is of major significance:


|    a. for maintaining domestic companies which are important for national defence; or  
|    b. for safeguarding Switzerland's public interests.

[4] The contracting authority shall prepare documentation with the following content on each contract awarded in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 3:


|    a. the name of the contracting authority and the tenderer selected;  
|    b. the type and value of the supplies procured;  
|    c. an explanation of the circumstances and conditions justifying the use of the direct award procedure.

[5] Public contracts may not be defined with the intention that only one specific tenderer is considered for the award from the outset, particularly due to the technical or artistic features of the contract (paragraph 2 letter c) or in the case of replacing, supplementing or extending supplies already provided (paragraph 2 letter e).

[**Art. 22** Design contest and study contracts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_22) 

[1] The contracting authority that organises a design contest or a competition to conduct studies including execution or awards study contracts shall regulate the procedure on a case-by-case basis in compliance with the principles of this Act. It may refer to the relevant provisions of trade associations.

[2] The Federal Council shall determine:


|    a. the types of design contest and the terms of study contracts;  
|    b. the types of procedure to be applied;  
|    c. the requirements in terms of preparatory work;  
|    d. the arrangements for the preliminary technical examination of the competition entries prior to their evaluation by the panel of experts;  
|    e. the specific terms for study contracts and design contest for the procurement of information and communication technology supplies;  
|    f. the make-up of the panel of experts and the requirements concerning the independence of its members;  
|    g. the tasks of the panel of experts;  
|    h. the conditions under which the panel of experts may decide on purchases;  
|    i. the conditions under which the panel of experts may rank competition entries that deviate from the provisions of the design contest programme;  
|    j. the manner in which prizes may be awarded and the claims that the winners may make depending on the type of design contest;  
|    k. the compensation for the creators of award-winning competition entries in cases where the contracting authority does not follow the recommendation of the panel of experts.

[**Art. 23** Electronic auctions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_23) 

[1] The contracting authority may hold an electronic auction for the procurement of standardised goods, work or services within the framework of a procedure under this Act. In this case, the tenders are revised after an initial full evaluation and re-ranked using electronic aids and, if necessary, multiple rounds. Reference must be made to this in the invitation to tender. 

[2] The electronic auction covers the following areas:


|    a. prices where the contract is to be awarded to the tenderer with the lowest total price; or  
|    b. prices and values for quantifiable components such as weight, purity or quality where the contract is to be awarded to the most advantageous tender.

[3] The contracting authority checks whether the tenderers meet the eligibility criteria and whether the tenders fulfil the technical specifications. It carries out an initial evaluation of the tenders based on the award criteria and the weighting established for this purpose. Before the auction begins, it provides each tenderer with the following:


|    a. the automatic evaluation method, including the mathematical formula based on the award criteria specified;  
|    b. the result of the initial evaluation of its tender; and  
|    c. all other relevant information regarding the auction process.

[4] All eligible tenderers are simultaneously invited electronically to submit new or amended tenders. The contracting authority may limit the number of eligible tenderers, provided it announced this in the invitation to tender or in the tender documentation.

[5] The electronic auction may comprise several successive rounds. The contracting authority informs all tenderers of their rank in each round.

[**Art. 24** Dialogue](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_24) 

[1] In the case of complex contracts, intellectual services or the procurement of innovative goods, work or services, a contracting authority may, within the framework of an open or selective procedure, conduct a dialogue with the aim of specifying the subject of the supply and identifying and defining the solutions or procedures. Reference must be made to the dialogue in the invitation to tender.

[2] The dialogue may not be conducted for the purpose of negotiating prices or total prices.

[3] The contracting authority formulates and explains its needs and requirements in the invitation to tender or in the tender documentation. It also discloses the following:


|    a. the dialogue process;  
|    b. the possible content of the dialogue;  
|    c. whether and how tenderers will be compensated for their participation in the dialogue and the use of their intellectual property rights, knowledge and experience;   
|    d. the timeframes and arrangements for submitting the final tender.

[4] It may reduce the number of participating tenderers by using objective and transparent criteria.

[5] It documents the process and content of the dialogue in an appropriate and comprehensible manner.

[6] The Federal Council may regulate the dialogue arrangements in more detail. 

[**Art. 25**  Framework agreements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_25) 

[1] The contracting authority may issue an invitation to tender towards agreements with one or more tenderers with the aim of determining the terms for the goods, work and services to be procured over a given period, in particular with regard to their price and, where appropriate, the quantities envisaged. The contracting authority may conclude individual contracts based on such a framework agreement during its term. 

[2] Framework agreements may not be used with the intention or effect of impeding or eliminating competition.

[3] The term of a framework agreement may not exceed 5 years. An automatic extension is not possible. A longer term may be envisaged in justified cases.

[4] If a framework agreement is concluded with only one tenderer, the individual contracts based on this framework agreement are concluded in accordance with the terms of the framework agreement. For the conclusion of the individual contracts, the contracting authority may ask the respective contracting party in writing to complete its tender.

[5] If framework agreements are concluded with several tenderers for sufficient reasons, the contracting authority may choose to conclude individual contracts either in accordance with the terms of the respective framework agreement without a new call for tenders or in accordance with the following procedure:


|    a. Before concluding each individual contract, the contracting authority consults the contracting parties in writing and informs them of the specific needs.  
|    b. The contracting authority sets the contracting parties a reasonable deadline for submitting tenders for each individual contract.  
|    c. The tenders must be submitted in writing and are binding for the period specified in the request.  
|    d. The contracting authority concludes the individual contract with the contracting party that submits the best tender based on the criteria defined in the tender documentation or framework agreement.

In compliance with Switzerland's international obligations, it shall in particular take into account, besides the price and quality, criteria such as appropriateness, timeframes, technical value, economic efficiency, life cycle costs, aesthetics, sustainable development, plausibility of the tender, the different price levels in the countries where the supply is provided, reliability of the price, creativity, customer service, delivery conditions, infrastructure, innovation content, functionality, service readiness, expertise or efficiency of the methodology.

[2] Outside the scope of international treaties, the contracting authority may additionally take into account the extent to which the tenderer provides apprenticeships places, jobs for older employees or jobs to reintegrate long-term unemployed people.

[3] The contracting authority shall indicate the award criteria and their weighting in the invitation to tender or in the tender documentation. The weighting may be omitted if the procurement concerns solutions, possible solutions or procedures.

[3] Certain companies or trademarks, patents, copyrights, designs or types, and references to a specific origin or to specific producers are not permitted as technical specifications, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or comprehensible way of describing the goods, work or services and the contracting authority includes the words "or equivalent" in the tender documentation. Equivalence has to be proven by the tenderer.

[4] The contracting authority may stipulate technical specifications for the conservation of natural resources or the protection of the environment.

[**Art. 31**  Bidding consortia and subcontractors](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_31)

|    b. the subject of the procurement, including technical specifications and certificates of conformity, plans, drawings and necessary instructions, as well as information on the quantity needed;   
|    c. formal requirements and participation conditions for the tenderers, including a list of data and documents that the tenderers must submit in connection with the participation conditions, as well as any weighting of the eligibility criteria;

[**Art. 37** Opening of tenders](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_37) 

[1] In the open and selective procedure, all tenders submitted on time are opened by at least two representatives of the contracting authority.

[2] Minutes of the tender opening are prepared. These must contain at least the names of the people present, the names of the tenderers, the date of their tender submission, any tender variants and the total price of each tender.

[3] If the supply and price tenders must be submitted in two separate envelopes, the envelopes must be opened in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, but only the total prices must be recorded in the minutes regarding the opening of the second envelope.

[4] At the latest after the contract has been awarded, all tenderers are granted access to the minutes upon request.

[**Art. 38**  Verification of tenders](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_38) 

[1] The contracting authority verifies the tenders received for compliance with the formal requirements. It corrects any obvious calculation errors.

[2] The contracting authority may require tenderers to explain their tenders. It keeps a written record of the request and the answers.

[3] If a tender is received with a total price that appears unusually low in comparison with the other tenders, the contracting authority must obtain appropriate information from the tenderer as to whether the participation conditions have been complied with and whether the other requirements of the invitation to tender have been understood.

[4] If supply and price tenders must be submitted in two separate envelopes, the awarding office first prepares a ranking according to the quality of the tenders. In a second step, it evaluates the total prices.

[**Art. 39**  Adjustment of tenders](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_39) 

[1] The contracting authority may work with the tenderers to adjust the tenders with regard to the goods, work or services and the arrangements for their provision in order to determine the most advantageous tender.

[2] An adjustment takes place only if:


|    a. this is the only way to clarify the contract or the tenders or to make the tenders objectively comparable in accordance with the award criteria; or  
|    b. supply changes are objectively and materially necessary, whereby what is to be supplied, the criteria and the specifications may not be adapted in such a way that the characteristic supply or the potential group of tenderers changes as a result.

[3] A call for price adjustments is permitted only in connection with the circumstances described in paragraph 2.

[4] The contracting authority logs the results of the adjustment.

[**Art. 40**  Evaluation of tenders](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_40) 

[1] Provided that the eligibility criteria and technical specifications are met, the tenders are examined and evaluated objectively, uniformly and comprehensibly in accordance with the award criteria. The contracting authority documents the evaluation.

[2] If the comprehensive examination and evaluation of tenders requires considerable time and effort, and provided that the contracting authority announced this in the invitation to tender, it may subject all tenders to an initial examination and rank them based on the documents submitted. Where possible, it selects the three best-ranked tenders on that basis and subjects them to a comprehensive examination and evaluation.

[**Art. 41** Award](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_41) 

The contract is awarded to the most advantageous tender.

[**Art. 42** Conclusion of the contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_42) 

[1] In the case of contracts outside the scope of international treaties, a contract may be concluded with the selected tenderer after the award has been made.

[2] In the case of contracts within the scope of international treaties, a contract may be concluded with the selected tenderer after expiry of the deadline for appealing against the award, unless the Federal Administrative Court has granted suspensive effect to an appeal against the award.

[3] If, in the case of contracts within the scope of international treaties, an appeal procedure against the award is pending without suspensive effect having been requested or granted, the contracting authority shall notify the court immediately of the conclusion of the contract.

[**Art. 43**  Abandonment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_43) 

[1] The contracting authority may abandon the award procedure, particularly if:


|    a. it decides not to award the public contract for valid reasons;  
|    b. no tender meets the technical specifications or the other requirements;  
|    c. more advantageous tenders are to be expected due to changes in the framework conditions;  
|    d. the tenders submitted do not allow for economical procurement, or significantly exceed the cost framework;  
|    e. there are sufficient indications of an unlawful agreement affecting competition between the tenderers;  
|    f. a significant change in the goods, work or services requested becomes necessary.

[2] Tenderers are not entitled to compensation in the event of a justified abandonment of the procedure.

[**Art. 44**  Exclusion from the procedure and revocation of the award](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_44) 

[1] The contracting authority may exclude a tenderer from an award procedure, delete it from a list or revoke a contract it has already been awarded if it is found that the tenderer concerned, one of its governing bodies, a third party called upon or one of such a party's governing bodies:


|    a. does not fulfil or no longer fulfils the conditions for participation in the procedure, or its behaviour jeopardises the legally compliant conduct of the award procedure;  
|    b. submitted a tender or request to participate that contains substantial formal errors or deviates substantially from the binding requirements of an invitation to tender;  
|    c. has been found guilty by a legally enforceable judgment of a misdemeanour to the detriment of the contracting authority or of a felony.  
|    d. is subject to attachment or bankruptcy proceedings;  
|    e. has violated anti-corruption provisions;  
|    f. refuses to allow inspections that have been ordered;  
|    g. has failed to pay taxes or social security contributions that are due;  
|    h. has failed to execute previous public contracts correctly or otherwise demonstrated that it is not a reliable and trustworthy partner;  
|    i. was involved in the preparation of the procurement and the resulting competitive disadvantage for the other tenderers cannot be offset by appropriate means;  
|    j. has been legally excluded from future public contracts under Article 45 paragraph 1.

[2] The contracting authority may also take measures in accordance with paragraph 1 if there are sufficient indications that the tenderer, one of its governing bodies, a third party called upon or one of such a party's governing bodies:


|    a. gave the contracting authority untrue or misleading statements and information;  
|    b. entered into unlawful agreements affecting competition;  
|    c. submitted an abnormally low tender without proving compliance with the participation conditions upon request and offers no guarantee that the goods, work or services put out to tender will be provided in accordance with the contract;  
|    d. infringed recognised professional rules or compromised their professional honour or integrity through its acts or omissions;  
|    e. is insolvent;  
|    f. disregard workplace health and safety regulations, terms and conditions of employment, the provisions on the equal treatment of men and women in terms of equal pay, the provisions on confidentiality and the provisions of Swiss environmental law or the international conventions for the protection of the environment designated by the Federal Council;   
|    g. violated reporting or authorisation obligations under the IEA;  
|    h. violated the Federal Act of 19 December 1986 on Unfair Competition.

[**Art. 45** Sanctions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_45) 

[1] If a tenderer or subcontractor which, either itself or through its governing bodies, fulfils to a serious extent one or more of the criteria referred to in Article 44 paragraph 1 letters c and e and paragraph 2 letters b, f and g, the contracting authority or the competent authority by virtue of the law order may exclude it from future public contracts for a period of up to 5 years. A warning may be issued in minor cases. In the case of corruption (Art. 44 para. 1 lit. e), the tenderer is excluded from contracts awarded by all federal contracting authorities; in the other cases, the tenderer is excluded from contracts awarded by the contracting authority concerned only.

[2] The possible sanctions apply irrespective of whether any further legal action is taken against the tenderer or subcontractor concerned or its governing bodies. The contracting authority shall notify the Competition Commission of any suspicion of unlawful agreements affecting competition (Art. 44 para. 2 lit. b).

[3] The contracting authority or the competent authority by virtue of the law shall notify an office designated by the Federal Council of a legally binding exclusion in accordance with paragraph 1. This office shall keep a non-public list of sanctioned tenderers and subcontractors, which records the reasons for the exclusion and the duration of the exclusion from public contracts. The office shall ensure that each contracting authority can obtain the relevant information in relation to a particular tenderer or subcontractor. It may establish a retrieval procedure for this purpose. The Confederation and the cantons shall allow mutual access to all information collected in accordance with this article. The entry is deleted from the list once the sanction has expired.

[**Art. 46** Deadlines](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_46) 

[1] When setting the deadlines for submitting tenders or requests to participate, the contracting authority shall take account of the complexity of the contract, the probable number of subcontracts and the mode of transmission.

[2] The following minimum deadlines apply within the scope of international treaties:


|    a. in an open procedure: 40 days from publication of the invitation to tender for the submission of tenders;  
|    b. in a selective procedure: 25 days from publication of the invitation to tender for the submission of requests to participate and 40 days from the invitation to prepare tenders for the submission of tenders. 

[3] Any extension of these deadlines must be published or notified to all tenderers in good time.

[4] Outside the scope of international treaties, the deadline for submitting tenders is generally at least 20 days. In the case of largely standardised goods, work and services, the deadline may be reduced to no shorter than 5 days.

[**Art. 47** Shortening of the deadlines within the scope of international treaties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_47) 

[1] The contracting authority may reduce the minimum deadlines set out in Article 46 paragraph 2 to no shorter than 10 days in cases of proven urgency.

[2] It may reduce the minimum 40-day deadline for submitting tenders under Article 46 paragraph 2 by 5 days if: 


|    a. the invitation to tender is published electronically;  
|    b. the tender documentation is simultaneously published electronically;   
|    c. tenders are received electronically.

[3] It may reduce the minimum 40-day period for submitting tenders under Article 46 paragraph 2 to no shorter than 10 days, provided it has published a prior notice with the following content at least 40 days and no more than 12 months before publication of the invitation to tender:


|    a. subject of the intended procurement;  
|    b. approximate timeframe for submitting tenders or requests to participate;

[4] It may reduce the minimum 40-day period for submitting tenders under Article 46 paragraph 2 to no shorter than 10 days if it is procuring goods, work or services required on a recurring basis and given notice of the shortening of the period in an earlier invitation to tender.

[5] Furthermore, the contracting authority may in any event reduce the deadline for submitting tenders to no shorter than 13 days when purchasing commercial goods, work or services or a combination of the two, provided it electronically publishes the tender documentation together with the invitation to tender. If the contracting authority accepts tenders for commercial goods, work or services electronically, it may also reduce the deadline to no shorter than 10 days.

[**Art. 48** Publications](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_48)

It also publishes awards that were made using the direct award procedure for contracts above the applicable threshold for the open or selective procedure. This does not apply to contracts awarded using the direct award procedure in accordance with Annex 5 section 1 letters c and d.

[2] The tender documentation is generally made available at the same time and electronically. Access to these publications is free of charge.

[3] The organisation commissioned by the Confederation and the cantons to develop and operate the internet platform may impose fees or charges for the contracting authorities, tenderers and other parties that use the platform or associated services. These are based on the number of publications or the scope of the services used.

[4] In the case of contracts within the scope of international treaties that are not published in an official language of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the contracting authority shall publish a summary of the notice in an official language of the WTO at the same time as the invitation to tender. The summary must contain at least the following:


|    a. subject of the procurement;  
|    b. timeframe for submitting tenders or requests to participate;   
|    c. where the tender documentation can be obtained.

[5] The Federal Council shall regulate any additional requirements concerning the languages of publications, the tender documentation, submissions by tenderers and the procedure. It may take appropriate account of Switzerland's plurilingualism. It may modify the requirements according to supply types. The following principles apply, subject to exceptions expressly specified by the Federal Council: 


|    a. In the case of construction contracts and associated supplies of goods and services, invitations to tender and awards must be published in at least two official languages, particularly in the official language at the construction location.

[2] The statistics shall contain at least the following information:


|    a. the number and total value of the public contracts awarded by each contracting authority, broken down into construction work, supply and service contracts, indicating the relevant CPC or CPV classification;

|    b. prejudice legitimate economic interests of the tenderers; or  
|    c. jeopardise fair competition between the tenderers.

[**Art. 52** Appeal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_52) 

[1] The contracting authorities' decisions may be appealed to the Federal Administrative Court:


|    a. in the case of supplies of goods or services: when the contract value exceeds the applicable threshold for the invitation procedure;  
|    b. in the case of construction work: when the contract value exceeds the applicable threshold for the open or selective procedure.

[2] In the case of contracts outside the scope of international treaties, the appeal may only seek a declaration that a decision violates federal law; this does not apply to appeals against decisions in accordance with Article 53 paragraph 1 letter i. Foreign tenderers may appeal if the state in which they are domiciled grants reciprocal rights.

[3] The Federal Supreme Court has direct jurisdiction for appeals against procurements of the Federal Administrative Court.

[4] Decisions under paragraph 1 letters c and i may be appealed irrespective of the value of the contract.

[5] There are no further rights of appeal against decisions under this Act. 

[6] There is no right of appeal against the conclusion of individual contracts in accordance with Article 25 paragraphs 4 and 5.

[**Art. 54** Suspensive effect](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_54) 

[1] The appeal does not have suspensive effect.

[2] The Federal Administrative Court may, upon request, grant suspensive effect to an appeal against a contract within the scope of international treaties if the appeal appears to be sufficiently justified and there are no overriding public interests to the contrary. As a rule, only an exchange of correspondence takes place on the issue of suspensive effect.

[3] A suspensive effect request that is an abuse of law or not made in good faith is not protected. Claims for damages by the contracting authority and the tenderer selected must be assessed by the civil courts.

[**Art. 55** Applicable law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_55) 

Unless otherwise provided for in this Act, the decision-making and appeals procedure is governed by the provisions of the Federal Act of 20 December 1968 on Administrative Procedure (APA).

[3] The appropriateness of a decision cannot be reviewed in appeal proceedings.

[4] Only those that can prove that they can and wish to provide the goods, work or services requested or equivalent goods, work or services may appeal against awards in the direct award procedure. An appeal may be filed only on the grounds that the direct award procedure was wrongly applied or that the contract was awarded based on corruption.

[**Art. 57** Inspection of files](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_57) 

[1] There is no right to inspect files in the decision-making procedure.

[2] In the appeal procedure, the complainant must be granted access, upon request, to the evaluation of its tender and other procedural files relevant to the decision, unless there are overriding public or private interests to the contrary.

[**Art. 58** Appeal decision](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/126/en#art_58) 

[1] The appeal body may decide on the case itself or refer it back to the previous instance or to the contracting authority. In the event of referral, it must issue binding instructions.

[2] If the appeal proves to be justified and the contract has already been concluded with the tenderer selected, the appeal body shall determine the extent to which the contested decision violates the applicable law.

[3] At the same time as establishing the violation, the appeal body shall decide on any claim for damages.

[4] Damages are limited to the necessary expenses incurred by the tenderer in connection with preparing and submitting its tender.
