# Asylum Act

## (AsylA)

of 26 June 1998 (Status as of 1 January 2021)

The Federal Assembly of the Swiss Confederation,

based on Article 121 of the Federal Constitution,

and having considered the Federal Council Dispatch of 4 December 1995,

decrees:

# [Chapter 1 Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#chap_1)

[**Art. 1** Subject matter](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_1) 

This Act regulates:


|    a. the granting of asylum and the legal status of refugees in Switzerland;  
|    b. the temporary protection of persons in need of protection in Switzerland and their return.

[**Art. 2** Asylum](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_2) 

[1] In response to an application, Switzerland grants asylum to refugees in accordance with this Act.

[2] Asylum includes the protection and the legal status granted in Switzerland to persons on the basis of their refugee status. It includes the right to stay in Switzerland.

[**Art. 3** Definition of the term refugee](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_3) 

[1] Refugees are persons who in their native country or in their country of last residence are subject to serious disadvantages or have a well-founded fear of being exposed to such disadvantages for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or due to their political opinions.

[2] Serious disadvantages include a threat to life, physical integrity or freedom as well as measures that exert intolerable psychological pressure. Motives for seeking asylum specific to women must be taken into account.

[3] Persons who are subject to serious disadvantages or have a well-founded fear of being exposed to such disadvantages because they have refused to perform military service or have deserted are not refugees. The provisions of the Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees are reserved.

[4] Persons who claim grounds based on their conduct following their departure that are neither an expression nor a continuation of a conviction already held in their native country or country of origin are not refugees. The provisions of the Convention of Refugee Convention are reserved.

[**Art. 4** Granting temporary protection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_4) 

Switzerland may grant temporary protection to persons in need of protection as long as they are exposed to a serious general danger, in particular during a war or civil war as well as in situations of general violence.

[**Art. 5** Ban on refoulement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_5) 

[1] No person may be forced in any way to return to a country where their life, physical integrity or freedom are threatened on any of the grounds stated in Article 3 paragraph 1 or where they would be at risk of being forced to return to such a country.

[2] The ban on refoulement may not be invoked if there are substantial grounds for the assumption that, because the person invoking it has a legally binding conviction for a particularly serious felony or misdemeanour, they represent a threat to Switzerland’s security or are to be considered dangerous to the public.

[**Art. 6**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_6) [Procedural principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_6) 

Procedures are governed by the Administrative Procedure Act of 20 December 1968 (APA), the Federal Administrative Court Act of 17 June 2005 and the Federal Supreme Court Act of 17 June 2005, unless this Act provides otherwise.

# [Chapter 2 Asylum Seekers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#chap_2)

## [Section 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#chap_2/sec_1)

[1] The State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) decides on granting or refusing to grant asylum as well as on removal from Switzerland.

[2] The Federal Council shall identify states in addition to the EU/EFTA states in which on the basis of its findings:


|    a. there is protection against persecution, as a safe native country or country of origin;  
|    b. there is efficient protection against refoulement as defined in Article 5 paragraph 1, as a safe third country.

[3] It shall periodically review decisions made in terms of paragraph 2.

[4] It shall provide the competent committees of the Federal Assembly with the list of states in accordance with paragraph 2 letter a for consultation prior to any amendment and at least once each year.

[**Art. 7** Proof of refugee status](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_7) 

[1] Any person who applies for asylum must prove or at least credibly demonstrate their refugee status.

[2] Refugee status is credibly demonstrated if the authority regards it as proven on the balance of probabilities.

[3] Cases are not credible in particular if they are unfounded in essential points or are inherently contradictory, do not correspond to the facts or are substantially based on forged or falsified evidence. 

[**Art. 8** Duty to cooperate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_8)

[3bis] Persons, who fail to cooperate without valid reason or fail to make themselves available for more than 20 days lose their right to have the procedure continued. This also applies to persons who fail for more than 5 days to make themselves available to the asylum authorities in a federal centre without a valid reason. Their applications are cancelled without a formal decision being taken. No new application may be filed within three years. The foregoing is subject to compliance with the Refugee Convention of 28 July 1951.

[2] Authorities and government offices shall seize and pass on to SEM travel documents, identity papers or other documents which may indicate the identity of person who has applied for asylum in Switzerland. Paragraph 5 applies to recognised refugees.

[3] If the authority or government office seizing documents in accordance with paragraph 2 examine these with regard to their authenticity, SEM must be notified of the results of this examination.

[4] Forged and falsified documents as well as genuine documents which have been misused may be confiscated by SEM or by the appellate authority or passed on to the agent.

[5] Passports or identity papers that have been issued to refugees recognised in Switzerland by their native country must be passed on to SEM.

[**Art. 11** Evidentiary procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_11) 

The asylum seeker may not express a view on the decision of the authority to conduct an evidentiary procedure to establish the facts of the case.

[**Art. 12**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_12) [Notification and service when living in a canton](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_12) 

[1] Any ruling or communication sent to the last known address of asylum seekers or of their agents becomes legally binding on expiry of the statutory seven-day time-limit for collection, even if the persons concerned do not learn of this until later due to a special agreement with Swiss Post or if the delivery is returned as undeliverable.

[2] If the asylum seeker is represented by several agents and if these do not indicate a joint address for service, the authority shall give notification of its rulings or direct communications to the first agent authorised by the asylum seeker.

[3] Notification may be given of rulings verbally and a summary statement of grounds provided. Verbal notification must be recorded in minutes that include a statement of the grounds. A copy of the minutes must be given to the asylum seeker or to his or her agent.

[**Art. 12***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_12_a) [Notification and service in federal centres](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_12_a) 

[1] In federal centres, notification of rulings is given and documents are served by hand. If the asylum seeker has disappeared, notification and service are governed by Article 12.

[2] If an asylum seeker has been assigned a legal representative, notification of rulings shall be given to and documents shall be served on the service provider tasked with providing legal representation. The provider shall inform the legal representative assigned of the notification or service on the same day as it is received.

[3] If an asylum seeker has not been assigned a legal representative, notification of rulings shall be given to and documents shall be served on the asylum seeker. An agent for the asylum seeker shall be informed immediately of the notification or service.

[4] Verbal notification and summary justification are governed by Article 12 paragraph 3.

[**Art. 13**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_13) [Notification and service in procedures at airports and in urgent cases](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_13) 

[1] The competent authorities may also notify persons applying for asylum at the border or at the border control at a Swiss airport (Art. 21–23) of a ruling by providing them with a signed copy of the ruling that has been transmitted by fax. The persons concerned must confirm in writing that they have received the ruling; in the absence of such confirmation, the competent authority shall formally record that the ruling has been received. Article 11 paragraph 3 of the APA does not apply. Any agent shall be informed of the notification.

[2] Article 12*a* applies mutatis mutandis to procedures at airports.

[3] In other urgent cases, SEM may authorise a cantonal authority, a Swiss diplomatic mission or a consular representation abroad (Swiss representation) to notify those concerned of a ruling by providing them with a signed copy of the ruling that has been transmitted by fax.

[**Art. 14**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_14) [Issues relative to the procedure for foreign nationals](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_14) 

[1] From filing an asylum application to departure from Switzerland in accordance with a legally binding removal order, following the withdrawal of an asylum application, or until the ordering of a substitute measure in the event that removal cannot be enforced, persons seeking asylum may not initiate any procedure for the granting of a residence permit under the law on foreign nationals unless they are entitled to be issued with such a permit.

[2] The canton may with consent of SEM grant a person for whom it is responsible in terms of this Act a residence permit if:


|    a. the person concerned has been a resident for a minimum of five years in Switzerland since filing the asylum application;  
|    b. the place of stay of the person concerned has always been known by the authorities;   
|    c. in light of their advanced stage of integration, there is a case of serious personal hardship; and  
|    d. there are no grounds for revocation under Article 62 paragraph 1 of the Foreign Nationals and Integration Act of 16 December 2005 (FNIA).

[3] If the canton wishes to take advantage of this opportunity, it shall inform SEM without delay.

[4] The person concerned shall only have party status during SEM's consent procedure.

[5] Pending proceedings for the granting of a residence permit become irrelevant with the filing of an asylum application.

[6] Residence permits remain valid and may be extended in accordance with the provisions of the law on foreign nationals.

[**Art. 15** Intercantonal offices](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_15) 

The cantons may establish intercantonal offices to fulfil the duties assigned to them in accordance with this Act, in particular for the hearing, preparation of the decision and the enforcement of any removal order.

[2] SEM rulings or interim rulings are issued in the official language spoken at the asylum seeker’s place of residence.

[3] SEM may derogate from paragraph 2 if:


|    a. the asylum seeker or his or her legal representative has a good command of a different official language;  
|    b. this is required to deal with applications efficiently and on time taking account of the number of applications received and the staff situation;  
|    c. the asylum seeker is allocated to a canton with a different official language by a federal centre.

[**Art. 17** Special procedural provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_17) 

[1] The provision of the Administrative Procedure Act of 20 December 1968 on legal holidays does not apply to asylum proceedings.

[2bis] Applications for asylum made by unaccompanied minors shall be processed as a priority.

[1ter] It shall authorise entry if Switzerland is competent to carry out the asylum procedure in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 and the asylum seeker:


|    a. appears to be at risk for any of the grounds stated in Article 3 paragraph 1 or under threat of inhumane treatment in the country from which they have directly arrived; or  
|    b. establishes that the country from which they have directly arrived would force them, in violation of the ban on refoulement, to return to a country in which they appear to be at risk.

[2] If, on the basis of the measures in accordance with paragraph 1 and the verification in accordance with paragraph 1bis, it is not immediately possible to determine whether the requirements for an entry permit in accordance with Article 1ter are fulfilled, entry shall be temporarily denied.

|    c. under the extended procedure, until they are allocated to a canton.

[4] The maximum duration of stay in federal centres is 140 days. Allocation to a canton shall take place after this period has elapsed. 

[5] A reasonable extension may be made to this period if it allows the asylum procedure to be concluded promptly or enables removal. The Federal Council shall determine the detailed rules for extending a stay in federal centres beyond the end of this period.

[6] Allocation to a canton may take place before the end of the period, in particular if there is a large and rapid rise in the number of asylum requests. Distribution and allocation are governed by Article 27.

[**Art. 24***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_24_a) [Special centres](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_24_a)

[4] After consulting the canton and commune concerned, the Confederation shall give notice to them of any change in use at the latest 60 days before the accommodation comes into operation.

[**Art. 24***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_24_d) [Accommodation in cantonal and communal centres](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_24_d)

[4] The provision of social assistance and emergency aid is governed by cantonal law.

[5] The Confederation shall make federal contributions by agreement to the canton or commune concerned to compensate for the administrative, staff and other costs which arise from fulfilling the tasks listed in paragraph 2. The compensation shall be fixed as a lump sum. In exceptional cases, the contributions may be fixed on the basis of expenditure, especially in the case of non-recurring costs.

[6] The other provisions concerning federal centres apply mutatis mutandis to cantonal and communal centres. In the centres defined in paragraph 1, the same procedures may be carried out as in federal centres as defined in Article 24. 

[**Art. 24***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_24_e) [Additional measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_24_e) 

The Confederation and the cantons shall take measures to respond promptly to changes in the number of requests for asylum with the resources required, in particular regarding accommodation, staff and finance, or with further measures.

[3] SEM shall inform asylum seekers of their rights and obligations in the asylum procedure. It may question the asylum seekers about their identity and their itinerary, and summarily about the reasons for leaving their country. At this point, SEM may also ask about any commercial human trafficking. It shall discuss with the asylum seeker whether there is sufficient justification for their request for asylum. If this is not the case and if the asylum seeker withdraws the request, the request shall be cancelled without a formal decision being taken and preparations made for the return journey.

[4] The comparison of data under Article 102*a*[bis] paragraphs 2–3, the examination of fingerprints under Article 102*a*[ter] paragraph 1 and the request for admission or readmission to the competent state bound by one of the Dublin Association Agreements is made during the preparatory phase. 

[5] SEM may delegate the tasks under paragraph 2 to third parties. Third parties are subject to the same duty of confidentiality as federal personnel.

[**Art. 26***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_26_a) [Establishing medical condition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_26_a) 

[1] Immediately after filing their application, but at the latest at the interview on the grounds for asylum under Article 36 paragraph 2 or being granted a hearing under Article 36 paragraph 1, asylum seekers must state any serious health problems of relevance to the asylum and removal procedures of which they were aware when filing the application for asylum.

[2] SEM appoints a competent medical specialist to investigate matters contended under paragraph 1. Article 82*a* applies mutatis mutandis. SEM may delegate the required medical duties to a third party.

[3] Medical problems that are claimed later or established by another medical specialist may be taken into account in the asylum and removal procedures if they are proven. The provision of prima facie evidence suffices by way of exception if there are excusable grounds for the delay or proof cannot be provided in the case in question for medical reasons. SEM may call in an independent medical examiner.

[**Art.****26***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_26_b) [Dublin procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_26_b) 

The procedure with view to a decision under Article 31*a* paragraph 1 letter b begins with submission of a request to a Dublin state for the admission or readmission of the asylum seeker. It lasts until the asylum seeker is transferred to the Dublin state responsible or until it is terminated and a decision is taken about implementing an accelerated or extended procedure.

[**Art. 26***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_26_c) [Accelerated procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_26_c) 

After the preparatory phase, the accelerated procedure shall commence immediately with an interview on the grounds for asylum or the granting of a hearing under Article 36. The Federal Council shall lay down the individual steps of the procedure. 

[**Art. 26***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_26_d) [Extended procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_26_d) 

If it is clear after the interview on the grounds for asylum that a decision cannot be made under the accelerated procedure, namely because further investigation is required, the asylum seeker shall be assigned to the extended procedure and be allocated to a canton under Article 27.

[**Art. 27** Distribution and allocation to the cantons](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_27)

[1] The cantons shall reach an agreement on the distribution of asylum seekers.

[1bis]The special services provided by cantons where federal centres or airports are located shall be appropriately taken into account in the distribution of asylum seekers.

[2] If the cantons cannot reach an agreement, the Federal Council shall, after hearing them, set out the criteria for distribution in an ordinance.

[3] SEM shall allocate asylum seekers to the cantons (cantons of allocation). In doing so, it shall take account of the interests of the cantons and of the asylum seekers that are worthy of protection. Asylum seekers may only contest the decision on allocation if it violates the principle of family unity.

[4] Persons whose removal has been ordered and in respect of whom a decision on asylum has become legally binding in a federal centre or whose request for asylum was cancelled in a federal centre shall not be allocated to a canton. 

[**Art. 28** Allocation of a place of stay and accommodation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_28) 

[1] SEM or the cantonal authorities may allocate asylum seekers to a place of stay.

[2] They may allocate asylum seekers accommodation, and in particular accommodate them as a group. The cantons shall ensure that this procedure is operated efficiently; they may lay down provisions and take measures.

[**Art. 29**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_29) [Interview on the grounds for asylum](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_29) 

[1] SEM shall interview asylum seekers on their grounds for asylum; the interview shall take place in a federal centre.

[1bis] If necessary, it shall call in an interpreter.

[2] The asylum seekers may be accompanied additionally at their own expense a person and an interpreter of their choice who are not themselves asylum seekers.

[3] Minutes shall be taken of the interview. They shall be signed by those participating in the interview.

[**Art. 29***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_29_a) [Cooperation in establishing the circumstances](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_29_a) 

The Federal Council may enter into agreements with third countries and international organisations on cooperation in establishing the circumstances of cases. It may in particular enter into agreements on a mutual exchange of information in order to establish the motives for seeking asylum of an asylum seeker in his or her native country or country of origin, his or her itinerary and his or her stay in a third country.

[1] SEM shall normally dismiss an application for asylum if the asylum seeker:


|    a. can return to a safe third country under Article 6*a* paragraph 2 letter b in which he or she was previously resident:  
|    b. can travel to a third country that is responsible under an international agreement for conducting the asylum and removal procedures;  
|    c. can return to a third country in which he or she was previously resident;  
|    d. can continue to a third country for which he or she holds a visa and in which he or she can seek protection;  
|    e. can continue to a third country in which persons with whom he or she has a close relationship or dependants live;  
|    f. can be removed to their native country or country of origin under Article 31*b*.

[2] Paragraph 1 letters c–e do not apply if there are indications in the case in question that the third country does not provide effective protection against refoulement in terms of Article 5 paragraph 1.

[3] SEM shall dismiss an application that fails to meet the requirements of Article 18. This applies in particular if the application for asylum is made exclusively for economic or medical reasons.

[4] In the other cases, SEM shall reject the application for asylum if refugee status has neither been proven nor credibly demonstrated or there are grounds for denying asylum under Articles 53 and 54.

[**Art. 31***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_31_b) [Recognition of asylum and removal decisions made in Dublin States](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_31_b) 

[1] An asylum seeker in respect of whom a negative asylum decision and a legally binding removal decision has been issued in a state that is bound by one of the Dublin Association Agreements (Dublin State) may be removed directly to their native country or country of origin in accordance with the requirements of Directive 2001/40/EC if:


|    a. the competent Dublin State has not executed any removals to the asylum seeker’s native country or country of origin for a long period; and  
|    b. it is likely that removal from Switzerland can be executed quickly.

[2] SEM shall obtain the information required to execute the removal from the competent authorities of the Dublin State concerned and make the necessary arrangements.

[1] If it is decided to dismiss an application under Article 31*a* paragraph 1, the asylum seeker is granted a hearing. The same applies if the asylum seeker:


|    a. deceives the authorities as to his or her identity and this deception is confirmed by the results of the identification procedure or other evidence;  
|    b. bases his or her application primarily on forged or falsified evidence;  
|    c. seriously and culpably fails to cooperate in some other way.

[2] In the other cases, an interview is held under Article 29.

[2] Notice of decisions under the accelerated procedure (Art. 26*c*) must be given within eight days of the conclusion of the preparatory phase.

[3] If there are valid reasons and it is foreseeable that the decision can be taken in a federal centre, the time limits laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 may be exceeded by a few days.

[4] Decisions under the extended procedure (Art. 26*d*) must be taken within two months of the conclusion of the preparatory phase.

[5] In other cases, decisions to dismiss an application must be made within five working days and decisions must be made within ten working days of the application being filed.

[6] SEM shall decide as a priority and immediately if the person seeking asylum is in detention pending extradition on the basis of a request by a state which the asylum seeker is seeking protection from in Switzerland. This also applies when the person has been made subject to an expulsion order under Article 66*a* or 66*a*[bis] of the Criminal Code (SCC) or Article 49*a* or 49*a*[bis] of the Military Criminal Code of 13 June 1927 (MCC).

SEM shall set out in a processing strategy which applications for asylum shall be processed as a priority. In doing so, it shall pay particular attention to the statutory time limits, the situation in the countries of origin, the evident merits or otherwise of the applications and the conduct of the asylum seekers.

If, as a result of questioning at the federal centre or at the interview, it is obvious that asylum seekers belong to a group of persons in need of protection in accordance with Article 66, they shall be granted temporary protection.

[**Art. 40** Rejection without further investigations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_40) 

[1] If, as a result of the interview, it is obvious that asylum seekers are unable to prove or credibly demonstrate their refugee status and there are no grounds preventing their removal, the application shall be rejected without further investigations.

[2] The decision must at least be summarily substantiated.

Any person who applies for asylum in Switzerland may stay in Switzerland until the conclusion of the procedure.

[**Art. 43** Authorisation for gainful employment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_43) 

[1] While staying in federal centres, asylum seekers may not be gainfully employed.

[1bis] The additional requirements for authorising gainful employment are governed by the Federal Act of 16 December 2005 on Foreign Nationals (FNIA).

[2] If an application for asylum is rejected in a legally binding decision, authorisation for gainful employment expires on expiry of the period specified for departure, even if an extraordinary legal remedy has been applied for and the enforcement of removal has been suspended. If SEM extends the departure period as part of the ordinary procedure, gainful employment may continue to be authorised. Gainful employment may not be authorised during proceedings under Article 111*c*.

[3] The FDJP may, in agreement with the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research authorise the cantons to extend permits for certain categories of persons to be gainfully employed beyond the expiry of the departure period, provided special circumstances justify this. This also applies mutatis mutandis to asylum proceedings under Article 111*c*.

[3bis] The Federal Council may issue a temporary ban on employment for certain groups of asylum seekers.

[4] Asylum seekers who are entitled to be gainfully employed in accordance with the immigration provisions or who participate in occupational programmes are not subject to the ban on employment.

[1] If SEM rejects or dismisses the application for asylum, it shall normally order and enforce removal from Switzerland; however, in doing so it shall take account of the principle of family unity. In addition, Articles 83 and 84 FNIA apply to the enforcement of the removal order.

[**Art. 44***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_44_a)

[**Art. 45** Removal order](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_45)

[1] The removal order shall indicate:


|    a. the obligation of the asylum seeker to leave Switzerland;  
|    b. the time by which the asylum seeker must have left Switzerland; where temporary admission has been granted, the departure date is determined when the decision is made to revoke temporary admission;  
|    c. the coercive measures that may be applied;  
|    d. if applicable, the designation of the states to which the asylum seeker may not be returned;  
|    e. if applicable, the ordering of an alternative measure instead of enforcing the removal order;  
|    f. the designation of the canton responsible for the enforcement of the removal order or the alternative measure.

[2] On issuing the removal order, an appropriate departure period of between seven and thirty days must be set*.* The period is seven days in the case of decisions taken under the accelerated procedure. Under the extended procedure, the period is between seven and thirty days*.*

[2bis] A longer period must be set or the departure period extended if special circumstances such as the family situation, health problems or a long period of stay so require*.*

[3] The removal order must be enforced immediately or a departure period of less than seven days may be set where the person concerned is being removed under the Dublin Association Agreements.

[4] The asylum seeker must be provided with an information sheet with an explanation of the removal order.

[**Art. 46** Enforcement by the cantons](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_46) 

[1] The canton of allocation is obliged to enforce the removal order.

[1bis] During an asylum seeker’s stay in a federal centre, the canton responsible for enforcing the removal order is the canton where the centre is located. For persons defined under Article 27 paragraph 4, the canton concerned remains responsible for enforcing the removal order even after the person’s stay in a federal centre. The Federal Council may in special circumstances allow for a canton other than the canton concerned to be allocated this responsibility.

[1ter] In the case of a multiple request under Article 111*c*, the canton responsible under the previous asylum and removal procedure remains responsible for removal and administering emergency care.

[2]If enforcement provides impossible for technical reasons, the canton shall apply to SEM for a system for monitoring the enforcement of removal.

[3] SEM supervises enforcement and, working with the cantons, shall establish a system for monitoring the enforcement of removal.

[**Art. 47** Measures where the place of stay is unknown](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_47) 

If asylum seekers subject to a removal order avoid enforcement of the order by concealing their place of stay, the canton or SEM may arrange for their registration in the police system for tracing missing persons.

[**Art. 48** Cantonal cooperation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_48) 

If asylum seekers are not located in the canton responsible for the enforcing the removal order, the canton of stay shall provide administrative assistance on request. Administrative assistance includes in particular delivering the person concerned to the competent canton or deporting them directly.

[**Art. 50** Country of second asylum](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_50) 

Refugees who have been admitted as such to another state may be granted asylum if they have resided in Switzerland in a law-abiding manner and without interruption for a minimum of two years.

[**Art. 51** Family asylum](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#art_51)

[1bis] If, during the asylum procedure, SEM has reason to believe that there are grounds under Article 105 number 5 or 6 of the Civil Code (CC) for the marriage to be annulled, they shall report this to the competent authority under Article 106 CC. The procedure shall be suspended until this authority makes its decision. If the authority raises an action for annulment, the request is suspended until a legally binding judgment has been issued.

[2] ...

[1] In times of increased international tension, in the event of the outbreak of an armed conflict in which Switzerland is not involved, or in the event of an exceptionally large influx of asylum seekers in times of peace, Switzerland shall grant asylum to refugees as long as the circumstances permit.

[2] The Federal Council shall take the required measures. It may, in derogation from the law, restrict the requirements for granting asylum and the legal status of the refugees and issue special procedural provisions. It shall submit a report on this to the Federal Assembly immediately.

[3] If Switzerland’s capacity to permanently accommodate refugees is exceeded, asylum may only be granted temporarily until those admitted are able to go elsewhere.

[4] If it becomes apparent that a considerable number of refugees are coming to Switzerland, the Federal Council shall seek rapid and effective international cooperation with a view to their reallocation to other countries.

## [Section 2 Asylum for Groups](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/en#chap_3/sec_2)
