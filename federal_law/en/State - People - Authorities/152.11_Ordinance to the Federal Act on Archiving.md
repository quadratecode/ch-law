|    a. to jeopardise the internal or external security of the Confederation;  
|    b. to lastingly affect relations with foreign countries, international organisations or between the Confederation and the cantons;  
|    c. to seriously affect the power of action of the Federal Council.

[4] An overriding and legitimate private interest in preventing consultation may exist in particular if consultation of the records would lead to a premature disclosure of professional or manufacturing secrets.

[5] Record groups with special retention periods in accordance with Article 12 paragraph 1 of the Act are listed in Annex 3. The Federal Department of Home Affairs may amend or supplement this list. The most recent list in each case shall be held at the Federal Archives and shall be publicly accessible. The updated appendix shall be published in the Official Record each year.
