[2] Persons who are called to act in an official capacity at an institutional beneficiary may, by way of exception, be authorised by the relevant cantonal authorities to carry out a secondary gainful activity for up to ten hours a week, provided that they are living in Switzerland and the activity concerned is not incompatible with the performance of their official duties. The decision of the cantonal authorities shall be taken in agreement with the FDFA.

[3] Teaching a specialised subject may, in particular, constitute an acceptable secondary activity, but any activity of a commercial nature, inter alia, shall be deemed incompatible with the performance of the person’s official duties.

[4] Persons who are called to act in an official capacity at an institutional beneficiary and who engage in a secondary gainful activity do not enjoy privileges or immunities of any kind in respect of that activity.

|    a. old-age, survivors‘ and invalidity insurance;  
|    b. accident insurance;  
|    c. loss of earnings compensation;  
|    d. family allowances;  
|    e. unemployment insurance; and   
|    f. maternity insurance.

[6] Income from the secondary gainful activity must be taxed in Switzerland unless a bilateral double taxation agreement provides otherwise.

|    b. the same-sex partner of the principal individual beneficiary within the meaning of Article 20 paragraph 1 letter b;  
|    c. the cohabiting partner of the principal individual beneficiary within the meaning of Article 20 paragraph 1 letter c;  
|    d. the unmarried children of the principal individual beneficiary, within the meaning of Article 20 paragraph 1 letter d if they entered Switzerland as authorised accompanying persons before the age of 21; they are entitled to facilitated access to employment until the age of 25, after which they must take the necessary steps to ensure that their residence and employment situations are in accordance with the legislation governing the residence and establishment of non-nationals;  
|    e. the unmarried children of the spouse, same-sex partner or cohabiting partner, within the meaning of Article 20 paragraph 1 letter e if they entered Switzerland as authorised accompanying persons before the age of 21; they are entitled to facilitated access to employment until the age of 25, after which they must take the necessary steps to ensure that their residence and employment situations are in accordance with the legislation governing the residence and establishment of non-nationals.

[2] To facilitate their access to employment, the FDFA shall, on request, issue to the persons referred to in paragraph 1 a document certifying to potential employers that the individual concerned is not subject to the quota on foreign workers, or to the principle of priority recruitment areas, or to labour market regulations (principle of priority preference for residents, and ex ante vetting of pay and conditions).

[3] Persons within the scope of paragraph 1 who engage in gainful activity shall, on submission of a contract of employment, an offer of employment, or a declaration to the effect that they intend to engage in a self-employed activity together with a description of that activity, be issued by the cantonal authority concerned with a special residence permit, known as a ‘Ci permit’, in place of their legitimation card. A self-employed activity may be carried out only after the Ci permit-holder has been authorised by the competent authorities to carry out the profession or occupation in question.

[4] Persons within the scope of paragraph 1 who engage in gainful activity in Switzerland are subject to Swiss law in relation to that activity. In particular, they enjoy no privileges or immunities in relation to that activity.

[5] Unless a social insurance agreement provides otherwise, they are subject to the Swiss legislation on:


|    a. old-age, survivors‘ and invalidity insurance;  
|    b. accident insurance;  
|    c. loss of earnings compensation;  
|    d. family allowances;  
|    e. unemployment insurance; and
