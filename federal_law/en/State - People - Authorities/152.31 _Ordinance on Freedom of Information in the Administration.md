3 A document shall be deemed to be for personal use, where it comprises information reserved for work-related purposes, provided that same shall solely be used by its creator or by a limited group of persons as work-supporting documentation, such as notes or working copies of documents.

# [Section 2 Right of Access to Official Documents](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/356/en#sec_2)

[**Art. 2**  Principle of equal access for everybody](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/356/en#art_2) 

(Art. 6 para. 1 FoIA)

If access to a public document is granted to one person, each further applicant is granted such access to the same degree.

(Art. 6 para. 1 and 3 FoIA)

1 The authority shall provide information to the applicant about the official documents available and shall assist him through the procedure, particularly if the applicant is disabled.

2 Where official documents are accessible via the Internet or have been published in an official publication of the Federal Government, the authority may confine itself to providing references as to the sources where they may be found.

3 The authority is not required to translate official documents to which access has been granted in application of the Freedom of Information Act.

1 Where it becomes apparent in the evaluation of an application for access that the public interest in obtaining such access would prejudice a third party’s right to the protection of privacy, the competent authority may, by way of an exception, grant access after having weighed up these interests against one another.

2 The public interest in gaining access shall outweigh the right to privacy where, in particular:


|    a. the granting of access to a document serves a specific public interest in obtaining such information, particularly due to important events;  
|    b. the granting of access serves to protect a specific public interest, and in particular the protection of public order and security and the protection of public health; or  
|    c. the person whose privacy could be prejudiced by access to an official document has a legal or factual relationship with an authority subject to the Freedom of Information Act which affords him significant benefits.
