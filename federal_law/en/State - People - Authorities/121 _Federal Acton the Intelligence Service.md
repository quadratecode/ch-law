[3] The FIS may in specific cases disclose personal data to states with which Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations if the requesting state provides a written assurance that it has the consent of the person concerned, and the requesting state will as a result be able to assess whether the person concerned can participate in classified projects carried out by that foreign state in relation to internal or external security or have access to classified information, materials or facilities of that foreign state.

[4] It may disclose personal data online to foreign security agencies whose states guarantee an appropriate standard of data protection and with which Switzerland has concluded an agreement in accordance with Article 70 paragraph 3.

[5] Personal data may not be disclosed to a foreign security agency if the person concerned will be exposed to the risk of being punished twice or of serious harm to his or her life, limb or freedom in terms of the Convention of 4 November 1950 on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms or other international agreements that Switzerland has ratified.

|    a. if and to the extent that there are overriding interests that are justified in the files in preserving secrecy in relation to the data about the person that is being processed that are connected with:  
|    1. the fulfilment of a task in accordance with Article 6, or  
|    2. a prosecution or other investigation;


|    b. if and to the extent that it is required because of overriding interests of third parties; or  
|    c. if no data about the applicant is being processed.

[3] The FIS shall notify the applicant that it is deferring the provision of information and advise the applicant that they have the right to request the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) that he examine whether the data, if any, is being lawfully processed and whether overriding interests in preserving secrecy justify the deferral.

[4] As soon as there are no longer any interests in preserving secrecy, but at the latest on expiry of the retention period, the FIS shall provide the applicant with information in accordance with the FADP unless there is excessive work and expense involved.

[5] The FIS shall notify persons in respect of whom no data is being processed of this fact no later than three years after receipt of their request.

[2] It shall notify the applicant either that no data relating to the applicant has been unlawfully processed or that it has identified errors relating to the deferral of the provision of information and has made a recommendation as defined in Article 27 FADP to the FIS in respect of their rectification.

[3] It shall notify the applicant that he or she may request the Federal Administrative Court to review this notification or the implementation of the recommendation.

[4] Article 27 paragraphs 4–6 FADP applies by analogy to the recommendation in accordance with paragraph 2.

[5] If the applicant credibly shows that a deferral of the provision of information will cause him or her considerable harm that cannot be rectified, the FDPIC may recommend that the FIS issue information immediately by way of exception provided this will not pose a risk to internal or external security.

[**Art. 65** Review by the Federal Administrative Court](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/494/en#art_65) 

[1] At the request of the applicant, the Federal Administrative Court shall conduct a review in accordance with Article 64 paragraph 3 and notify the applicant thereafter that it has done so.

[2] If there have been errors in relation to data processing or the deferral of the provision of information, the Federal Administrative Court shall issue a ruling on their rectification to the FIS. The foregoing also applies if the FDPIC’s recommendation is not followed. The FIS may appeal against this ruling to the Federal Supreme Court.
