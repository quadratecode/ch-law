|    c. less coercive alternative measures cannot be applied effectively (Art. 28 para. 2 der Regulation [EU] No 604/2013).

[2] The following specific indications suggest that the person concerned intends to evade removal:


|    a. The person concerned disregards official orders in the asylum or removal proceedings, in particular by refusing to disclose their identity, thus failing to comply with their duty to cooperate under Article 8 paragraph 1 letter a AsylA or by repeatedly failing to comply with a summons without sufficient excuse.  
|    b. Their conduct in Switzerland or abroad leads to the conclusion that they wish to defy official orders.  
|    c. They submit two or more asylum applications under different identities.  
|    d. They leave the area that they are allocated to or enter an area from which they are excluded under Article 74.  
|    e. They enter Swiss territory despite a ban on entry and cannot be removed immediately.  
|    f. They stay unlawfully in Switzerland and submit an application for asylum with the obvious intention of avoiding the imminent enforcement of removal.  
|    g. They seriously threaten other persons or considerably endanger the life and limb of other persons and are therefore being prosecuted or have been convicted.  
|    h. They have been convicted of a felony.  
|    i. They deny to the competent authority that they hold or have held a residence document and/or a visa in a Dublin State or have submitted an asylum application there.

[3] The person concerned may remain or be placed in detention from the date of the detention order for a maximum duration of:


|    a. seven weeks while preparing the decision on responsibility for the asylum application; this includes submitting the request to take charge to the other Dublin State, waiting for the response or tacit acceptance, and drafting and giving notice of the decision;  
|    b. five weeks during proceedings under Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1560/2003;  
|    c. six weeks to ensure enforcement from notice being given of the removal or expulsion decision or the date on which the suspensive effect of any appeal against a first instance decision on removal or expulsion ceases to apply and the transfer of the person concerned to the competent Dublin State.

[4] If a person refuses to board the means of transport being used to effect the transfer to the competent Dublin State, or if they prevent the transfer in any other way through their personal conduct, they may, in order to guarantee the transfer, be placed in detention if a detention order under paragraph 3 letter c is no longer possible and a less restrictive measure will not achieve a satisfactory result. The person may be detained until transfer is again possible, but no longer than six weeks. The period of detention may be extended with the consent of a judicial authority if the person concerned remains unprepared to modify their conduct. The maximum duration of this period of detention is three months.

[5] The days in detention count towards the maximum duration in terms of Article 79.

[**Art. 77** Detention pending deportation due to lack of cooperation in obtaining travel documents](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_77) 

[1] The competent cantonal authority may detain a person to ensure the enforcement of their removal or expulsion if:


|    a. an enforceable decision has been made;   
|    b. they have not left Switzerland by the appointed deadline; and  
|    c. the cantonal authority has had to obtain travel documents for this person.

[2] Detention may last a maximum of 60 days.

[3] The required arrangements for the enforcement of the removal or expulsion must be made without delay.

[**Art. 78** Coercive detention](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_78) 

[1] If a person does not fulfil their obligation to leave Switzerland by the appointed deadline and if the legally enforceable removal or expulsion order or legally enforceable order for expulsion from Switzerland under Article 66*a* or 66*a*[bis] SCC or Article 49*a* or 49*a*[bis] MCC cannot be enforced due to their personal conduct, they may be detained to ensure the obligation to leave Switzerland is complied with, provided it is not permitted to order detention pending deportation and a more lenient measure would lead to the goal.

[2] Detention may be ordered for one month. It may, however, be extended by two months with consent of the cantonal judicial authority if the person concerned remains unwilling to change their conduct and leave the country. Article 79 remains reserved.

[3] Detention and its extension are ordered by the authorities of the canton which is responsible for enforcing the removal or expulsion order. If the person concerned is already in detention based on Articles 75, 76 or 77, they may be left in detention if the requirements of paragraph 1 are fulfilled.

[4] The first-time detention order must be reviewed at the latest after 96 hours by a judicial authority on the basis of an oral hearing. At the request of the detainee, the extension of detention must be reviewed by the judicial authority within eight working days on the basis of an oral hearing. The power of review is governed by Article 80 paragraphs 2 and 4.

[5] The conditions of detention are governed by Article 81.

[6] The detention order is revoked if:


|    a. the person concerned is unable to leave Switzerland independently and in the proper manner, even though they have fulfilled the obligations to cooperate specified by the authorities;  
|    b. they leave Switzerland as ordered;  
|    c. detention pending deportation is ordered;  
|    d. a request for release from detention is granted.

[1] Detention in preparation for departure, detention pending deportation in accordance with Articles 75–77 and coercive detention in accordance with Article 78 must not together exceed the maximum term of detention of six months. 

[2] The maximum term of detention may be extended with the consent of the cantonal judicial authority for a specific period, but in no case for more than twelve months and in the case of minors aged between 15 and 18, by a maximum of six months where:


|    a. the person concerned fails to cooperate with the competent authority;  
|    b. the provision of the documents required for departure by a State that is not a Schengen State is delayed. 

[**Art. 80** Detention order and detention review](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_80) 

[1] Detention shall be ordered by the authorities of the canton responsible for enforcing the removal or expulsion order. In the case of persons staying in federal centres, the canton where the centre is located is responsible for ordering detention in preparation for departure. In cases covered by Article 76 paragraph 1 letter b number 5, detention shall be ordered by the canton where the centre is located.

[1bis] In cases under Article 76 paragraph 1 letter b number 5, detention is ordered by the canton in which the the federal centres are located; if in accordance with Article 46 paragraph 1[bis] third sentence AsylA a canton other than the canton where the centres are located is responsible for executing removal, that canton is also responsible for ordering detention.

[2] The legality and the appropriateness of detention must be reviewed at the latest within 96 hours by a judicial authority on the basis of an oral hearing. If detention pending deportation has been ordered in accordance with Article 77, the detention review procedure shall be carried out in writing.

[2bis] In the case of detention under Article 76 paragraph 1 letter b number 6, the legality and the appropriateness of detention shall be reviewed at the request of the detainee by a judicial authority in a written procedure. This review may be requested at any time.

[3] The judicial authority may dispense with an oral hearing if deportation is anticipated within eight days of the detention order and the person concerned has expressed their consent in writing. If deportation cannot be carried out by this deadline, an oral hearing must be scheduled at the latest twelve days after the detention order.

[4] When reviewing the decision to issue, extend or revoke a detention order, the judicial authority shall also take account of the detainee’s family circumstances and the circumstances behind the enforcement of detention. In no event may any detention order in preparation for departure, detention pending deportation or coercive detention be issued in respect of children or young people who have not yet attained the age of 15.

[5] The detainee may submit a request for release from detention one month after the detention review. The judicial authority must issue a decision on the request on the basis of an oral hearing within eight working days. A further request for release in the case of detention in accordance with Article 75 may be submitted after one month or in the case of detention in accordance with Article 76, after two months.

[6] The detention order shall be revoked if:


|    a. the reason for detention ceases to apply or the removal or expulsion order proves to be unenforceable for legal or practical reasons;  
|    b. a request for release from detention is granted;  
|    c. the detainee becomes subject to a custodial sentence or measure.

[4] The detainee may apply for release from detention at any time. The judicial authority must decide on the application within eight working days in a written procedure.

[5] The detention of children and young persons under 15 years of age is not permitted.

[6] In the case of a detention order in respect of an unaccompanied minor seeking asylum, the representative under Article 64*a* paragraph 3[bis] of this Act or under Article 17 paragraph 3 AsylA will be informed in advance.

[**Art. 81**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_81) [Conditions of detention](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_81) 

[1] The cantons shall ensure that a person in Switzerland designated by the detainee is notified. Detainees may communicate with their legal representatives as well as with their family members and consular authorities both verbally and in writing.

[2] Detention shall take place in detention facilities intended for the enforcement of preparatory detention, detention pending deportation and coercive detention. If this not possible in exceptional cases, in particular because of insufficient capacity, detained foreign nationals must be accommodated separately from persons in pre-trial detention or who are serving a sentence.

[3] The needs of vulnerable persons, unaccompanied minors and families with minor children must be taken into account in the detention arrangements.

The calculation of contributions and the procedure are governed *mutatis mutandis* by Sections 2 and 6 of the Federal Act of 5 October 1984 on Federal Subsidies for the Execution of Sentences and Measures.

2 The Confederation shall contribute to the cantons’ operating costs for detaining persons in preparation for departure or pending deportation, or placing persons in coercive detention by making a flat-rate daily payment. The flat-rate payment shall be made in the case of:


|    a. asylum seekers;  
|    b. refugees and other foreign nationals who are detained in connection with the revocation of temporary admission;  
|    c. foreign nationals whose detention has been ordered by the SEM in connection with a removal order;

# [Chapter 11 Temporary Admission](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#chap_11)

[**Art. 83** Order for temporary admission](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_83) 

[1] If the enforcement of removal or expulsion is not possible, not permitted or not reasonable, the SEM shall order temporary admission.

[2] Enforcement is not possible if the foreign national is unable to travel or be brought either to their native country or to their country of origin or a third country.

[3] Enforcement is not permitted if Switzerland’s obligations under international law prevent the foreign national from making an onward journey to their native country, to their country of origin or to a third country.

[4] Enforcement may be unreasonable for foreign nationals if they are specifically endangered by situations such as war, civil war, general violence and medical emergency in their native country or country of origin.

[5] The Federal Council shall designate native countries or countries of origin or areas of these countries to which return is reasonable. If foreign nationals being removed or expelled come from one of these countries or from a member state of the EU or EFTA, enforcement of removal or expulsion is reasonable.

[5bis] The Federal Council shall periodically review the decision under paragraph 5.

[6] Temporary admission may be requested by the cantonal authorities.

[7] Temporary admission shall not be ordered in terms of paragraphs 2 and 4 if the person removed or expelled:


|    a. has been sentenced to a long-term custodial sentence in Switzerland or abroad or has been made subject to a criminal law measure in terms of Article 59–61 or 64 of the SCC;  
|    b. has seriously or repeatedly violated or represented a threat to public security and order in Switzerland or abroad or represented a threat to internal or the external security; or  
|    c. has made their removal or expulsion impossible due to their own conduct.

[8] Refugees for whom there are reasons for refusing asylum in accordance with Articles 53 and 54 AsylA shall be granted temporary admission.

[9] Temporary admission shall not be granted or shall expire if an order for expulsion from Switzerland under Article 66*a* or 66*a*[bis] SCC or Article 49*a* or 49*a*[bis] MCC becomes legally enforceable.

[10] The cantonal authorities may conclude integration agreements with temporarily admitted persons if there is a special need for integration in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 58*a*.

[**Art. 84** Termination of temporary admission](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_84) 

[1] The SEM periodically examines whether the requirements for temporary admission are still met.

[2] The SEM shall revoke temporary admission and order the enforcement of removal or expulsion if the requirements no longer met.

[3] At the request of the cantonal authorities, fedpol or the FIS, the SEM may revoke temporary admission due to the unreasonableness or impossibility of enforcement (Art. 83 paras 2 and 4) and order the enforcement of removal if there are grounds in terms of Article 83 paragraph 7.

[4] Temporary admission expires in the event of definitive departure, an unauthorised stay abroad of more than two months, or on the granting of a residence permit.

[5] Applications for a residence permit made by temporarily admitted foreign nationals who have resided in Switzerland for more than five years are closely examined with regard to integration, family circumstances and the reasonableness of return to the country of origin. 

[**Art. 85** Regulation of temporary admission](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_85) 

[1] The permit for temporarily admitted persons (Art. 41 para. 2) is issued by the canton of residence for a maximum of twelve months for control purposes and is extended subject to the reservation of Article 84.

[2] For the allocation of temporarily admitted persons, Article 27 AsylA applies *mutatis mutandis*.

[3] Temporarily admitted persons must submit their application to move to another canton to the SEM. The SEM shall make a final decision subject to the reservation of paragraph 4 on the change of canton after hearing the cantons concerned.

[4] The decision on the change of canton may only be contested on the ground that it violates the principle of family unity.

[5] Temporarily admitted persons are free to choose their place of residence within their current canton or the canton to which they are allocated. The cantonal authorities may allocate a place or residence or accommodation to temporarily admitted persons who are not recognised as refugees, and who are in receipt of social assistance.

[6] ...

[7] Spouses and unmarried children under 18 years of temporarily admitted persons and temporarily admitted refugees may be reunited with the temporarily admitted persons or refugees at the earliest three years after the order for temporary admission and included in that order if:


|    a. they live with the temporarily admitted persons or refugees;  
|    b. suitable housing is available;  
|    c. the family does not depend on social assistance;  
|    d. they can communicate in the national language spoken at the place of residence; and  
|    e. the family member they are joining is not claiming annual supplementary benefits under the SBA or would not be entitled to receive such benefits because of family reunification.

[7bis] In order to be granted temporary, it is sufficient to register for a language support programme as an alternative to meeting the requirement set out in under paragraph 7 letter d.

[7ter] In the case of single children under the age of 18, the requirement set out in paragraph 7 letter d does not apply. The requirement of Article 49*a* paragraph 2 may be also waived for good cause.

[8] If, on assessing the reunification of spouses in accordance with Articles 42–45, the SEM has reason to believe that there are grounds under Article 105 numbers 5 or 6 CC for the marriage to be annulled, they shall report this to the competent authority under Article 106 CC. The request for the reunification of spouses is suspended until this authority makes its decision. If the authority raises an action for annulment, the request is suspended until a legally binding judgment has been issued.

[**Art. 85***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_85_a) [Right to work](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_85_a) 

[1] Temporarily admitted persons may work anywhere in Switzerland if the salary and employment conditions customary for the location, profession and sector are satisfied (Art. 22).

[2] The employer must report the start or end of employment to the cantonal authority responsible for the place of work in advance. The report must, in particular, contain the following information: 


|    a. the identity and salary of the employed person;  
|    b. the activity carried out;  
|    c. the place of work.

[3] The employer must include a declaration in the report, stating that he is aware of the salary and employment conditions customary for the location, profession and sector, and that he is committed to observing them. 

[4] The authority referred to in paragraph 2 shall immediately send a copy of the report to the supervisory bodies responsible for verifying compliance with the salary and employment conditions. 

[5] The Federal Council shall designate the competent supervisory bodies. 

[6] It shall regulate the reporting procedure.

[1] The cantons shall regulate the terms and the payment of social assistance and emergency aid for temporarily admitted persons. The provisions of Articles 80*a*–84 AsylA relating to asylum seekers apply. Support for temporarily admitted persons is normally provided in the form of benefits in kind. The level of support is less than that offered to persons resident in Switzerland. 

[1bis] The same provisions on social assistance standards apply to the following persons as for refugees who have been granted asylum in Switzerland:


|    a. temporarily admitted refugees;  
|    b. refugees subject to a legally enforceable expulsion order under Article 66*a* or 66*a*[bis] SCC or Article 49*a* or 49*a*[bis] MCC;  
|    c. stateless persons in accordance with Article 31 paragraphs 1 and 2; and  
|    d. stateless persons subject to a legally enforceable expulsion order under Article 66*a* or 66*a*[bis] SCC or Article 49*a* or 49*a*[bis] MCC.

[**Art. 87** Federal subsidies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_87) 

[1] The Confederation pays the cantons:


|    a. a flat-rate payment for every temporarily admitted person in accordance with Articles 88 paragraphs 1 and 2 and 89 AsylA;  
|    b. a flat-rate payment in accordance with Articles 88 paragraph 3 and 89 AsylA for every temporarily admitted refugee and every stateless person in accordance with Article 31 paragraph 2;

|    d. a flat-rate payment in accordance with Articles 88 paragraph 3 and 89 AsylA for every stateless person in accordance with Article 31 paragraph 1 and every stateless person subject to a legally enforceable expulsion order under Article 66*a* or 66*a*[bis] SCC or Article 49*a* or 49*a*[bis] MCC.

[2] The assumption of departure costs and payment of return assistance are governed by Articles 92 and 93 AsylA.

[3] Flat-rate payments in terms of paragraph 1 letters a and b are made for a maximum of seven years after entry.

[4] Flat-rate payments in terms of paragraph 1 letter d are made for a maximum of five years after recognition of statelessness.

[5] The Federal Council may stipulate a flat-rate charge based on the expected costs.

[6] It may request security for the payment of costs.

[**Art. 94**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_94) [Cooperation with the authorities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/758/en#art_94)
