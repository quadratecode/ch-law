[1bis] The Federal Council shall determine, four months prior to the polling day at the latest, which proposals are to be submitted to the vote of the People. This period of four months may be reduced in the case of federal acts that have been declared to be urgent.

[2] Each canton is responsible for the conduct of the vote within its own territory and issues the required regulations.

[**Art. 10***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_10_a) [Information for persons eligible to vote](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_10_a)

[2] In doing so, it shall comply with the principles of completeness, objectivity, transparency and proportionality.

[1] The Confederation shall provide the cantons with the proposals to be submitted to a vote of the People and the ballot papers.

[2] Each proposal shall be accompanied by a short, objective explanation from the Federal Council that shall also take account of the opinions of significant minorities. The proposal must contain the wording of the questions on the ballot paper. In the case of popular initiatives and referendums, the initiative committee shall inform the Federal Council of their arguments and the Federal Council shall take such arguments into account in its explanatory statement. The Federal Council may amend or reject defamatory, blatantly false or excessively long statements. References to electronic sources may be included in the explanatory statement only if the author of the references declares in writing that none of the content of the sources is illegal and that the sources are not linked to electronic publications with illegal content.

[3] Persons eligible to vote shall receive the documents required to cast a valid vote under cantonal law (ballot paper, polling card, official voting envelope, validation stamp, etc.) at least three and no more than four weeks prior to the polling day. Proposals submitted to a vote of the People and explanatory statements may be sent at an earlier date. The Federal Chancellery shall publish the proposals and the explanatory statement electronically at least six weeks prior to the polling day.

|    b. have been completed other than by hand;   
|    c. do not permit the intention of the voter to be clearly recognised;  
|    d. contain defamatory remarks or obviously irrelevant markings;  
|    e. …

[2] Grounds for invalidity or nullity that relate to cantonal procedures (official voting envelope, validation stamp, etc.) are reserved.

[3] In the case of electronic voting pilot schemes, the legislation of each canton conducting such a scheme shall determine the requirements according to which votes are validly cast and the grounds for invalidity.

[1] Blank and invalid ballot papers shall be disregarded when determining the result of the vote.

[2] Where the yes-votes in a canton are equal in number to the no-votes, the vote of that canton shall be counted towards the cantons voting no.

[3] A very close result requires a recount if there are credible allegations of irregularities that by their nature and extent could have influenced the federal result.

[1] In every polling station, a report shall be drawn up on the result of the vote which states the total number of persons eligible to vote and the number of Swiss citizens resident abroad who are eligible to vote, the total number of voters, the total number of blank, invalid and valid ballot papers, and the number of votes cast in favour of and against the proposal.

[2] The report shall be sent to the cantonal government. The cantonal government shall compile the provisional results from the entire canton, notify the Federal Chancellery of the results and publish the same in the official cantonal gazette within 13 days of the polling day.

[3] The cantons shall submit the report, and if so requested, the ballot papers, to the Federal Chancellery within ten days of expiry of the period allowed for an appeal to be lodged (Art. 79 para. 3). Following validation of the result of the vote, the ballot papers shall be destroyed.

[**Art. 15** Validation and publication of the result of the vote](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_15) 

[1] The Federal Council shall ascertain the result of the vote (validation) as soon as it is established that no appeal against the vote has been filed with the Federal Supreme Court, or as soon as a decision has been made on such an appeal.

[2] The validation decree shall be published in the Federal Gazette.

[3] Amendments to the Federal Constitution shall come into force on their adoption by the People and the cantons, unless the proposal provides otherwise.

[4] Where a change in the law cannot be delayed and as soon as the result of the vote is beyond dispute, the Federal Council or the Federal Assembly may bring draft legislation or federal decrees on the adoption of international treaties provisionally into force prior to the completion of the validation procedure, or in the case of acts that have been declared to be urgent, allow such acts to continue in force, or repeal the same.

# [Title 3 Election of the National Council](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#tit_3)

## [Chapter 1 General](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#tit_3/chap_1)

[**Art. 16**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_16) [Allocation of seats to the cantons](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_16) 

1 The allocation of seats in the National Council among the cantons is based on the figures for the resident population obtained from the register-related surveys carried out as part of the census in accordance with the Census Act of 22 June 2007 in the first calendar year following the previous general elections to the National Council.

2 Based on the binding figures for the resident population in accordance with Article 13 of the Census Act of 22 June 2007, the Federal Council shall make a binding decision on the number of seats to be allocated to each canton in the follow general election to the National Council.

[**Art. 17**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_17) [Allocation procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_17) 

The 200 seats in the National Council shall be allocated among the cantons in accordance with the following procedure:


|    a. *Preliminary allocation**:*  
|    1. The resident population of Switzerland is divided by 200. To obtain the first allocation number, the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number, unless it is already a whole number, in which case it is increased to the next highest whole number. Each canton whose population is lower than this number is allocated one seat, and is excluded from the further stages of the allocation procedure.  
|    2. The resident population of the remaining cantons is divided by the number of seats that have yet to be allocated. To obtain the second allocation number, the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number, unless it is already a whole number, in which case it is increased to the next highest whole number. Each canton whose population is lower than this number is allocated one seat, and is excluded from the further stages of the allocation procedure.  
|    3. This procedure is repeated until the remaining cantons reach the final   
allocation number.


|    b. *Principal allocation*: each remaining canton is allocated as many seats as its population divided by the final allocation number.  
|    c. *Final allocation*: the remaining seats are divided among the cantons with the highest fractions of a whole number remaining. Where more than one canton has the same remaining fraction, the canton or cantons with the lower or lowest remaining number that results from the division of their population by the first allocation number are excluded. If this also results in the same remaining number for more than one canton, the allocation of the remaining seats is decided by drawing lots.

[**Art. 18**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_18)

[**Art. 19** Date of the election](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_19) 

[1] The ordinary general election to the National Council shall be held on the second last Sunday in October. The cantonal government shall fix the earliest possible date for by-elections and supplementary elections.

[2] The Federal Council shall fix the date for an extraordinary general election in terms of Article 193 paragraph 3 of the Federal Constitution.

[**Art. 20** Drawing of lots](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_20) 

If lots must be drawn, this takes place in the canton subject to the orders of the cantonal government, or at a federal level subject to the orders of the Federal Council.

[1] Any person who uses the ballot paper that is not pre-printed may enter the names of eligible candidates and add the list designation or reference number of an electoral list.

[2] Any person who uses a pre-printed ballot paper may delete pre-printed candidate names; they may enter the names of candidates from other electoral lists (splitting the vote). They may also delete the pre-printed reference number and electoral list designation or replace the same with the number and designation of a different list.

[3] They may enter the name of the same candidate on the ballot paper twice (accumulating).

[**Art. 36**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_36) [Votes for deceased candidates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_36) 

Votes for candidates who have died in the period since the final rectification of any deficiencies in the candidate lists (Art. 29 para. 4) are counted as personal votes for those candidates.

[**Art. 37** Additional votes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_37) 

[1] Where a ballot paper contains fewer valid votes for candidates than the number of seats in the National Council allocated to the constituency, the lines that have not been completed on the ballot paper count as additional votes for the electoral list whose designation or reference number is entered on the ballot paper. In the absence of a designation or reference number, or if the ballot paper contains more than one of the eligible list designations or reference numbers, the uncompleted lines are not counted (blank votes).

[2] Where more than one regional list with the same designation has been submitted in any canton, additional votes on a ballot paper that does not designate the region are counted towards the list relating to the region in which the ballot paper is handed in.

[2bis] In the case of the other possible applications of Article 31 paragraph 1bis, the additional votes are counted towards the list whose designation is entered on the ballot paper. The additional votes on insufficiently designated ballot papers are counted towards the electoral list that has been declared to be the parent list by the group. 

[3] Names that do not appear on any electoral list pertaining to the constituency are deleted. …

[4] Where there is a contradiction between the electoral list designation and the reference number, the electoral list designation shall take precedence.

|    b. are not official;  
|    c. have been completed or altered other than by hand;;  
|    d. contain defamatory remarks or obviously irrelevant markings;  
|    e. …

[2] The following shall be deleted from the ballot paper:


|    a. superfluous repetitions if the name of a candidate appears more than twice on a ballot paper;  
|    b. all names of persons whose candidacies were declared invalid due to multiple candidacy following the rectification of the candidate lists.

[3] If the ballot paper contains more names than there are seats to be allocated, the last pre-printed names on the list that have not been accumulated by hand shall be deleted followed by the last names that have been added by hand.

[4] Grounds for invalidity or nullity that relate to the cantonal procedure (official voting envelope or validation stamp, etc.) remain reserved.

[5] In the case of electronic voting pilot schemes, the legislation of each canton conducting such a scheme determines the requirements according to which votes are validly cast and the grounds for invalidity.

[1] The number of valid party votes for all the electoral lists is divided by a number equivalent to the number of mandates to be allocated plus one. To obtain the allocation number, the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number, unless it is already a whole number, in which case it is increased to the next highest whole number.

[2] Each electoral list shall be allocated as many mandates as the number obtained by dividing the number of votes cast in favour of the list by the allocation number.

[3] …

[**Art. 41**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_41) [Additional allocations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_41) 

[1] Where not all of the mandates have been allocated, the mandates remaining shall be allocated individually and one after the other according to the following rules:


|    a. the number of votes cast in favour of each electoral list is divided by a number equivalent to the number of mandates already allocated to that list plus one.  
|    b. the next mandate is allocated to the electoral list that has the largest quotient.  
|    c. if more than one list is entitled to the next mandate as they have the same quotient, then the next mandate is allocated to the list that achieved the highest remainder in the division according to Article 40 paragraph 2.  
|    d. if there are still two or more lists with the same right to the mandate, the mandate goes to the list that has obtained the highest number of party votes.  
|    e. if more than one list still has the same right to the mandate, the first mandate is allocated to the list whose candidate for the mandate has obtained the highest number of votes.  
|    f. if more than one candidate has obtained the same highest number of votes, the mandate is allocated by drawing lots.

[2] This procedure is repeated until all the mandates have been allocated.

[3] Where two or more candidates have received the same number of votes, their order of precedence shall be decided by drawing lots.

[**Art. 44** Excess of seats](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/688_688_688/en#art_44)

[1] Where all the lists when taken together do not contain more candidates than there are mandates to be allocated, the cantonal government shall declare all the candidates on the lists to be elected.

[2] Where all the lists when taken together contain fewer candidates than there are mandates to be allocated, supplementary elections shall be held in accordance with Article 56 paragraph 3 in respect of the mandates that cannot be allocated.

[2] Where a ballot paper contains more names than there are mandates to be allocated, the last names on the paper shall be deleted.

[3] The provisions that apply to constituencies that return only one member also apply by analogy.

[1] The withdrawal of a popular initiative is normally unconditional.

[2] However, if Federal Assembly has approved an indirect counter-proposal in the form of a federal act at the latest at the same time as the final vote on the popular initiative, the initiative committee may withdraw its popular initiative under the express condition that the indirect counter-proposal is not rejected in a popular vote.

[3] The conditional withdrawal becomes effective as soon as:


|    a. the deadline for requesting a referendum against the indirect counter-proposal has expired without a request being filed;  
|    b. a legally binding declaration has been made that the request for a referendum against the indirect counter-proposal has failed; or  
|    c. the Federal Council has, in accordance with Article 15 paragraph 1, validated the result of the popular vote where a request for a referendum has succeeded and the People have voted for the indirect counter-proposal.

[2] There is cohesion of subject matter in a popular initiative when there is an intrinsic connection between the individual parts of the initiative.

[3] There is consistency of form in a popular initiative when the initiative is couched exclusively in the form of a general proposal or of a specific draft provision.

[2] In the event of a conditional withdrawal in favour of an indirect counter-proposal, the Federal Council shall submit the popular initiative to the vote of the People and the cantons within ten months of its validation in accordance with Article 15 paragraph 1 of the result of the popular vote rejecting the indirect counter-proposal.

[3] If a popular initiative in the form of a general proposal is approved, the draft amendment to the Constitution shall be submitted to a vote of the People and the cantons within ten months of the final vote in the Federal Assembly.

[1] Where the Federal Assembly decides to submit a counter-proposal, three questions are put to the voters on the same ballot paper. Each person who is eligible to vote may state, without reservation:


|    a. whether they prefer the popular initiative to the law currently applicable;  
|    b. whether they prefer the counter-proposal to the law currently applicable;  
|    c. which of the two proposals should become law where both the People and the cantons prefer both proposals to the law currently applicable.

[2] The absolute majority shall be established separately for each question. Questions that have not been answered shall be disregarded.
