[1] The authority may refuse to allow the inspection of the files only if:


|    a. essential public interests of the Confederation or the cantons, and in particular the internal or external security of the Confederation, require that secrecy be preserved;

[1] If it is probable that a ruling will affect numerous persons or if it is not possible to identify all the parties without incurring unreasonable expense, the authority, before issuing its ruling, may publish the application or the intended ruling without stating the grounds in an official gazette while at the same time making the application or the intended ruling with the grounds therefor available for public inspection, giving notice of where it may be inspected.

[1] The authority shall admit the evidence offered if it appears reliable for determining the facts of the case.

[2] If taking the evidence entails comparatively high costs, and if the party will be liable for costs if the ruling is not in his favour, the authority may make the taking of evidence dependent on the party making an advance payment, within a specific period, of the costs that may reasonably be incurred; a party without financial means shall be exempted from the obligation to make advance payment.

[4] If necessary, the authority shall order a translation to be obtained.

[2] In order to encourage an agreement, the authority may appoint a neutral and suitably qualified natural person to be a mediator.

[3] The mediator shall be bound only by the law and his mandate from the authority. He may take evidence; for inspections, reports from experts and the examination of witnesses, he shall require prior authorisation from the authority.

[4] The authority shall make the agreement the content of its ruling, unless the agreement is defective in terms of Article 49.

[5] If an agreement is reached, the authority shall not charge any procedural fees. If no agreement is reached, the authority may dispense with imposing the costs of mediation on the parties, provided the interests involved justify this.

[3] ...

[4] Instructions that an appellate authority issues if it decides in the case and refers the same back to the lower instance are not regarded as instructions within the meaning of paragraph 2.
