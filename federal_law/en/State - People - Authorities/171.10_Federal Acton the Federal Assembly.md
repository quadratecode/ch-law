[3bis] The presidents of the competent committees may by mutual agreement return to the prosecution authorities applications providing insufficient grounds for lifting immunity so that these can be rectified.

If the majority in a committee elects to discuss an application, the application is dealt with according to the standard procedure under Article 17*a*.

[2] If the decisions of both committees on whether to consider the application or lift immunity do not correspond, the committees shall attempt to resolve their differences. The second rejection of an application by a committee is final.

[4] The committees shall hear the accused assembly member. The member may not be represented or accompanied.

The regulations of each council shall designate the competent committee.

[2] The foregoing does not apply to a precautionary arrest due to a risk of absconding or where the member is caught in the act of committing a felony. The authority ordering the arrest must apply within 24 hours directly to the competent committee of the council to which the arrested member belongs for its consent, unless the person concerned has given his or her own consent to being arrested.

[3] If criminal proceedings in respect of the offences named in paragraphs 1 and 2 have already been commenced against an assembly member at the start of a session, the member has the right to request a decision by the competent committee of the council to which he or she belongs on the continuation of any detention that has already been ordered and on any summons to attend court hearings. The submission of such a request has no suspensive effect on orders already made.

[4] The right to attend a session may not be invoked against a legally enforceable judgment that imposes a custodial sentence the execution of which has been ordered prior to start of the session.

|    a. a pending bill is to be divided up;  
|    b. a counter-proposal is to be made to a popular initiative on the same constitutional issue (Art. 101).

It shall submit its proposal in relation to a committee motion that is submitted less than a month before the start of the next ordinary session by the start of the session following the next session.

[2] If one chamber rejects a motion, the motion is regarded as having been dealt with. If the chamber to which the motion has been submitted approves the same, the motion goes to the other chamber.

[3] A motion accepted by the first chamber may in the second chamber be:


|    a. irrevocably accepted or rejected;  
|    b. amended on the proposal of the majority of the committee responsible for the preliminary examination or on the proposal of the Federal Council.

[4] If the second chamber makes an amendment, the first chamber may in the second consideration:


|    a. agree to the amendment;  
|    b. stand by its decision to accept the motion in its original form; or  
|    c. irrevocably reject the motion.

[4bis] If the first chamber in the second consideration stands by its decision to accept the motion in its original form, the second chamber may agree to this decision or irrevocably reject the motion.

[5] A motion accepted by the first chamber without the agreement of the second chamber shall be irrevocably accepted if:

[1] If a motion is still pending after two years, the Federal Council shall report to the Federal Assembly each year on what it has done in relation thereto and on how it intends to fulfil the mandate. This report shall be submitted to the committees responsible.

[2] A committee or the Federal Council shall request that a motion be closed if its mandate has been fulfilled. The request shall be addressed to both chambers unless the motion relates to issues of the organisation or procedure of a specific chamber. 

[3] A request for a motion to be closed may also be made if the mandate has not been fulfilled but the motion should no longer be pursued. The request shall be justified:


|    a. with a special report on the motion to be closed; or  
|    b. in a dispatch on a Federal Assembly bill on subject matter connected with the motion.

[4] If the decisions of the two chambers on the request to close a motion do not correspond, the procedure for the settlement of differences in Article 95 applies.

[5] If a request to close a motion is rejected by both chambers, the Federal Council must fulfil the mandate contained in the motion within one year or within the period fixed by the two chambers on rejecting the request.

[6] If the Federal Council fails to comply with the period fixed, a decision on extending the period allowed or on closing the motion shall be taken in the next ordinary session in both chambers at the request of the committees responsible.
