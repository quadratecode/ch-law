(Art. 48 paras. 4 and 5 of the PPA)

1In derogation from Article 48 paragraph 5 letters a and b of the PPA, a publication may exceptionally be produced in one official language of the Confederation and in another language, if it:

[1] For supplies of goods and services, the tender documentation shall, as a general rule, be written in the two official languages of the Confederation in which the invitation to tender was published. 

2The contracting authority may publish the tender documentation in only one official language of the Confederation if, on the basis of reactions to an advance notice or other indications, it is to be expected that there is no need to publish the tender documentation in two official languages. 

3In addition, the tender documentation may be written in only one official language of the Confederation or, in cases specified in Article 20, in another language if:


|    a. a translation would result in considerable additional costs; considerable additional costs are deemed to exist when the cost of translation would exceed 5% of the contract value or CHF 50,000; or

2In selecting the language of the procedure, it shall consider as far as possible the language region from which the most tenders can be expected for the goods or services to be provided. For construction work and associated supplies of goods and services, it shall be assumed that most tenders will be received in the official language at the site of the construction. 

3Unless otherwise agreed, the contracting authority shall communicate with the tenderers in the language of the procedure. It shall answer questions on the tender documentation in the language of the procedure or in the official language of the Confederation in which they were submitted.

The calculation shows the total production costs according to the industry's standard cost breakdown, as well as the risk premia and profit.

[5] If the check reveals that the price is too high, the contracting authority shall order the difference to be refunded or a price reduction applied in the future, unless the contract provides otherwise. An increase in price as a result of the check is excluded.
