### [Section 2 Social Assistance when Abroad](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#tit_1/chap_4/sec_2)

(Art. 24 and 27 SAA)

[**Art. 18** Basic principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_18) 

1 Social assistance benefits may be paid to Swiss Abroad on a recurring or one-off basis.

2 Recurring benefits are guaranteed for a maximum of one year and this guarantee may be renewed.

[**Art. 19** Entitlement to recurring benefits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_19) 

1 A person is entitled to receive recurring benefits if:


|    a. their eligible expenses exceed their eligible incomes;  
|    b. their liquid assets, with the exception of the exempt asset allowance, have been used up; and  
|    c. they have a legitimate reason to remain in the receiving state taking all the circumstances into account, particularly if they:  
|    1. have already been in the receiving state for several years,  
|    2. are very likely to become financially independent in the receiving state in the foreseeable future, or  
|    3. prove that they cannot reasonably be expected to return to Switzerland due to close family ties or other relationships.



2 The issue of whether the relevant benefits would be more cost-effective in Switzerland or abroad is irrelevant.

[**Art. 20** Entitlement to one-off benefits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_20) 

1 A person is entitled to receive one-off benefits, if:


|    a. their eligible incomes, after deduction of their eligible expenses, are insufficient to cover a one-off expense which is necessary to meet their basic needs; and   
|    b. no liquid assets are available that exceed the exempt allowance.

2 A one-off benefit may be granted in addition to recurring benefits.

[**Art. 21** Eligible expenses](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_21) 

1 Eligible expenses are:


|    a. an allowance to cover household expenses (housekeeping allowance);  
|    b. other recurring expenses, such as accommodation costs, insurance premiums and mobility costs, provided they are necessary, reasonable and substantiated.

2 Debts and debt interest are not recognised as eligible expenses. In exceptional cases, they may be recognised in part or in full as such if they were incurred as a result of essential expenditure, such as accommodation costs, insurance premiums, mobility or hospital costs.

[**Art. 22** Eligible incomes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_22) 

Eligible incomes are all incomes that an applicant receives or could receive in due time.

[**Art. 23** Household allowance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_23) 

1 The household allowance is based on the rates applicable in Switzerland, although it is adjusted to reflect the basic cost of living in the relevant country or region.

2 It is graduated based on the size of the household.

[**Art. 24** Exempt asset allowance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_24) 

1 The exempt asset allowance is set by the CD in such a way as not to hinder the possibility of the person concerned being able to support themselves again through their own means in the foreseeable future.

2 The exempt asset allowance amounts to a maximum of:


|    a. six times the household allowance for individuals;  
|    b. twelve times the household allowance for married couples or couples in a registered partnership.

3 If the applicant has children under 18, the exempt asset allowance is increased by a maximum of three times the household allowance per child.

4 If there are grounds to assume that the applicant will not be able to accumulate new assets in the foreseeable future, the exempt asset allowance may be increased to double the maximum amount set out in paragraph 2.

[**Art. 25** Level of recurring benefits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_25) 

1 The recurring benefits amount to the total discrepancy between the eligible expenses and eligible incomes.

2 The CD sets this amount on the basis of a budget.

[**Art. 26** Recurring benefits due to stays in public institutions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_26) 

Benefits for persons in homes, hospitals and other establishments abroad comprise the statutory or legal daily allowances for a stay in a public institution plus ancillary expenses and pocket money.

### [Section 3 Returning to Switzerland](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#tit_1/chap_4/sec_3)

(Art. 30 para. 2 SAA)

[**Art. 27** Entitlement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_27) 

1 Swiss Abroad who are unable to cover the costs of their return to Switzerland are entitled to claim the travel costs to return to Switzerland.

2 Return to Switzerland means travelling to Switzerland with the intention of staying there permanently.

3 The travel costs are paid irrespective of whether the Swiss nationals claimed benefits while they were abroad.

[**Art. 28** Amount](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_28) 

The travel costs paid for the return to Switzerland comprise:


|    a. the costs of the most appropriate and cheapest way of travelling to Switzerland;  
|    b. the benefits needed abroad until the time of departure;  
|    c. if required, the benefits needed from arrival in Switzerland until the first contact with the relevant social service authority.

[**Art. 29** Notification](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/654/en#art_29) 

If the CD allows a Swiss national living abroad to return to Switzerland at the expense of the Confederation, it shall notify the competent cantonal authorities.
