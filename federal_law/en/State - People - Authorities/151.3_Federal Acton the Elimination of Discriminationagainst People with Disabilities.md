[1] The Act has the purpose of preventing, reducing or eliminating discrimination against people with disabilities.

[2] It lays down general conditions that make it easier for people with disabilities to participate in society and in particular to cultivate social contacts independently, and to have access to basic and advanced education and training and to employment.

[**Art. 2** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2003/667/en#art_2) 

[1] In this Act, a *person with a disability* is a person who, due to a physical, mental or psychological impairment which is likely to be permanent, finds it difficult or is unable to carry out everyday tasks, cultivate social contacts, move around, obtain an education or training, or work.

[2] *Discrimination* occurs when persons with disabilities are treated in legal or practical terms differently from persons without disabilities and thus without material justification are disadvantaged when compared to persons without disabilities, or when they are not treated differently but different treatment is necessary to ensure that persons with disabilities have the same rights as persons without disabilities.

[3] *Discrimination relating to access* *to* *a* *building*, *a* *structure*, *a* *dwelling* *or a* *public transport facility* *or vehicle* occurs when access for persons with disabilities is not possible for structural reasons or is only possible with difficulty.

[4] *Discrimination in obtaining a service* occurs when it is impossible or only possible with difficulty for persons with disabilities to obtain a service.

[5] *Discrimination in access to general and advanced education and training* occurs in particular when:


|    a. it is difficult for persons with disabilities to use aids or obtain the necessary assistance from other persons;  
|    b. the duration and organisation of the course and examinations are not adapted to the specific needs of persons with disabilities.
