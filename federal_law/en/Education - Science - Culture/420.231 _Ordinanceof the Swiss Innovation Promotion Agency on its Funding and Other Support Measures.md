|    b. non-commercial research centres outside the higher education sector as set out in Article 5 RIPA;  
|    c. government research institutions as set out in Article 16 paragraph 3 RIPA which must conduct their own research projects for the appropriate fulfilment of their remit;  
|    d. federal research institutes as set out in Article 17 RIPA.

[3] Implementation partners are private or public institutions or businesses that are responsible for implementation.

[4] Research and implementation partners must be independent from one another in terms of finances and personnel. The implementing provisions of the Innovation Council (implementing provisions) stipulate the criteria by which independence is assessed.

[**Art. 4** Assessment criteria](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/734/en#art_4) 

Funding is awarded based on the following key criteria:


|    a. the innovative content of the project, measured in terms of the current state of research and the competitive situation in the market;  
|    b. the quality of the project planning, quantitative goals and implementation plan to achieve the targeted economic or social benefit;  
|    c. the competence of the project team members to implement the project;  
|    d. the project’s contribution to sustainable development.

[**Art. 5** Calculation of project contributions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/734/en#art_5) 

For the calculation of Innosuisse project contributions, the following budgeted project costs are eligible:


|    a. personnel costs in accordance with Article 6;  
|    b. material costs, provided they are needed to implement the project, do not concern the basic equipment of a research centre, and are not covered by the financial contribution paid by the implementation partner to the research partner in accordance with Article 7 paragraph 4. These may include costs for apparatus, consumables, third-party services and travel. Material costs may be claimed as capital expense or operating expense.

[**Art. 6** Personnel costs for the calculation of project contributions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/734/en#art_6) 

[1] The actual gross salaries paid to project team members for time spent working on the project are eligible.

[2] The implementing provisions set out maximum eligible gross salaries. The maximum amounts may only be exceeded if justification can be provided on a case-by-case basis that the participation of the higher-paid project team member is vital to the successful implementation of the project.

[3] In addition to the gross salaries, the actual employer contributions paid under OASIA / InvIA / LECA, OPA, UIA and AIA are also eligible.

[4] The implementing provisions stipulate how the salary costs under paragraph 1 and the employer contributions under paragraph 3 should be disclosed and billed. Allowance shall be made in particular for the special features of the different types of research centres.

[5] No personnel costs may be claimed for project team members whose appointment is already fully financed by the public sector or other third-party funds.

[**Art. 7** Contribution of implementation partners to project costs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/734/en#art_7) 

[1] The implementation partners shall contribute to the overall project costs and shall at least match the project contributions from Innosuisse. A reduced participation from implementation partners in accordance with Article 30 RIPO remains reserved.

[2] The contribution of every implementation partner comprises an in-kind contribution and a financial contribution to the research partner.

[3] The actual personnel and material costs incurred by the implementation partner that are directly connected to the project qualify as the in-kind contribution. If the actual personnel costs exceed the maximum amounts set out in the implementing provisions referred to in Article 6 paragraph 2, the amounts in the implementing provisions apply.

[4] The financial contribution paid to research partners must in total amount to at least 10 per cent of the project contribution under Article 5. The contribution referred to in paragraph 1 may involve a higher financial contribution where it is demonstrably intended to cover the project costs within the meaning of Articles 5 and 6.

[5] Innosuisse may, in individual cases, allow a share of less than 10 per cent, or waive the financial contribution to the research partner completely if the economic capacity of the implementation partner is insufficient. In this regard, it shall take account of the innovation potential of the project, the risks associated with the project and the viability of the financial burden associated with implementation of the project.

[6] If several implementation partners are involved in one project, they shall agree on the relevant shares between them and inform Innosuisse of the split.

[**Art. 8** Overhead contributions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/734/en#art_8) 

[1] The overhead contribution is calculated as a percentage of the personnel costs referred to in Article 6.

[2] The applicable percentage is defined for the subsequent calendar year and published on the Innosuisse website.

[3] The applicable percentage is the one that applies at the time the application is submitted.

[4] The overhead contribution is paid out together with the contribution tranches for direct project costs, and in the same percentages as the latter.

[**Art. 9** Funding administration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/734/en#art_9) 

[1] If a project involves several research partners, the contributions must be managed by a grant administration office.

[2] Research partners undertake to make all contractually required declarations to the grant administration office and to submit all documents and supporting documentation. They are responsible for ensuring that only eligible expenses in accordance with the Innosuisse regulations are billed.
