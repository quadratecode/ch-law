[**Art. 1** Aim](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/2080_2080_2080/en#art_1) 

This Act has the aim:


|    a. of providing the Confederation with the statistical principles that it requires to fulfil its duties;  
|    b. of making public statistical results available to the cantons, the communes, the economy, the private sector, representatives from civil society and the general public;  
|    c. of gearing the organisation of federal statistical bodies towards gathering and processing data efficiently and in a manner considerate to interviewees;  
|    d. of promoting national and international cooperation in the area of statistics;  
|    e. of ensuring data protection within federal statistical bodies.

[**Art. 2** Scope of application](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/2080_2080_2080/en#art_2) 

[1] This Act applies to all statistical activities:


|    a. instructed by the Federal Council;  
|    b. conducted or commissioned by the Federal Administration’s administrative units, not including the Federal Institutes of Technology.

[2] The Federal Council shall determine which articles of the Act are applicable to the statistical activities of the Federal Institutes of Technology, Swiss Post, and the telecommunications enterprises of the Confederation.

[3] It may declare the provisions of this Act to be applicable for other public corporations, institutions or private individuals, if these entities:


|    a. are under the supervision of the Confederation;  
|    b. receive financial aid or payments from the Confederation; or  
|    c. are engaged in an activity requiring a licence or authorisation from the Confederation.

[4] When making an entity subject to this Act in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3, the Federal Council shall take account of the freedom of research as well as the statutory duties and the autonomy of the organisations concerned.

[**Art. 3** Duties of the federal statistical bodies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/2080_2080_2080/en#art_3) 

[1] Federal statistical bodies prepare representative results in a professionally independent way on the status of and changes in the population, the economy, society, education, research, spatial planning and the environment in Switzerland.

[2] They assist in:


|    a. the preparation, conduct and review of federal tasks;  
|    b. the assessment of specialist fields in which the duties of the federal government and cantons are closely interlinked, such as education, science and research, culture, sport, legal matters, tourism, public finances, land management, construction and residential accommodation, transport, energy, healthcare and welfare;  
|    c. supporting research projects of national importance;  
|    d. the assessment of the fulfilment of the constitutional mandate to establish equal opportunities for men and women and for disabled and non-disabled people;  
|    e. the evaluation of the employability and activities of university graduates.

[3] To perform these duties, the Confederation works together with the cantons, the communes, academia, the private sector and representatives from civil society as well as foreign and international organisations, and if possible takes their information needs into account.

[**Art. 4** Principles of data collection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/2080_2080_2080/en#art_4) 

[1] Insofar as the Confederation has the necessary data available or that such data becomes available to an organisation subject to this Act in the implementation of federal law (federal administrative data), separate surveys need not be conducted by federal statistical bodies (direct surveys, indirect surveys or surveys based on observations and measurements).

[2] In the event that the data required by federal statistical bodies on third parties is available from cantonal or communal agencies or from other entities of the public law, such data must be collected from said agencies or entities (indirect survey).

[3] Direct surveys require the collection of new data at source by interviewing natural persons and legal entities for the sole purposes of this Act. The number and type of surveys are limited to what is strictly necessary.

[4] In the case of surveys conducted in terms of this Act, the Confederation gives notice of the purpose and the legal basis for processing the data, and the categories of participants in the data records and the data recipients.

[5] The organisations, agencies and other public legal entities in terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 must make the data available to the Federal Statistical Office free of charge.

# [Section 2 Power to Commission Surveys and Participation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/2080_2080_2080/en#sec_2)

|    b. surveys with no disclosure obligation relating to a small group of companies and businesses under private and public law;  
|    c. one-off surveys that relate to a small group of persons.

[3] The federal institutions for research promotion and research centres subject to this Act may instruct surveys with no disclosure obligation that are one-off or limited in time.

[4] Other organisations governed by this Act in accordance with Article 2 paragraphs 2 or 3 have the autonomous power to instruct:


|    a. surveys that do not include the collection of any personal data;  
|    b. surveys with no disclosure obligation relating to natural persons and legal entities under private and public law that work with the organisation in order to fulfil its other duties;  
|    c. surveys with the disclosure obligation if this is provided for by another act.

[5] Surveys for the purpose of testing methodology may be conducted without special instruction, provided there is no disclosure obligation.

[**Art. 6** Obligations of the interviewees](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/2080_2080_2080/en#art_6)

[3] Any person who provides information voluntarily for a survey must do so in a truthful manner and to the best of their knowledge. The Federal Council may provide compensation for voluntary information where its provision requires an exceptional amount of time and effort from the interviewees.

[4] The Federal Council may on, commissioning a survey, require natural persons and legal entities under private and public law and their representatives to disclose information if this is absolutely necessary for the completeness, representativeness, comparability or up-to-dateness of a statistic. The persons and entities under this obligation are required to provide the information truthfully, within the deadline, free of charge and in the prescribed form.

[**Art. 7** Participation of the cantons and the communes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/2080_2080_2080/en#art_7) 

[1] On commissioning a survey, the Federal Council shall determine the extent to which the cantons and communes participate in conducting the survey.

[2] It may instruct the transfer of data from their data records, provided the legal basis for the data records does not expressly exclude use of such data for statistical purposes. In the event that the data is subject to a statutory duty of confidentiality, it may not be divulged in accordance with Article 19 of this Act as well as with Article 22 of the Data Protection Act of 19 June 1992.

[**Art. 10** Federal Statistical Office](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/2080_2080_2080/en#art_10) 

[1] The Federal Statistical Office (Federal Office) is the central statistical office of the Confederation. It provides statistical services for the administrative units of the Confederation, for other users of data produced by federal statistical bodies and for the general public.

[2] The Federal Office coordinates federal statistical bodies and draws up standard principles in the interests of national and international comparability. It prepares the multi-year programme in cooperation with other statistical offices and after consulting interested parties. It normally conducts the surveys and prepares comprehensive compilations of data, provided the Federal Council does not assign this duty to another statistical office or federal office.

[3] The Federal Office cooperates closely with the cantons in the maintenance of a Business and Enterprise Register (BER) used as an aid in conducting surveys on businesses and enterprises. The Federal Council may provide that specific data is also used for purposes related to specific persons in the public interest.

[3bis] The Federal Office cooperates closely with the cantons in the maintenance of a Federal Register of Buildings and Dwellings (RBD). Access to the Register for statistical, research and planning purposes and to fulfil statutory obligations is open to the Confederation, and to each canton and commune in respect of the data pertaining to its territory. The Federal Council shall regulate the management of the Register and decree more detailed provisions on data protection. Insofar as no personal data is involved, the Federal Council may make the data in the register accessible to the public.
