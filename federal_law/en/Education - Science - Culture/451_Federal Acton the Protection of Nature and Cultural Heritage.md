The Federal Assembly of the Swiss Confederation,

based on Article 78 paragraph 4 of the Federal Constitution,  
in implementation of the Nagoya Protocol of 29 October 2010 on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (Nagoya Protocol),

The aim of this Act, subject to the authority of the Confederation under Article 78 paragraphs 2–5 of the Federal Constitution, is:


|    a. to carefully manage and protect heritage landscapes and sites of local character, historical sites, and the country’s natural and cultural monuments, and to promote their preservation and upkeep;  
|    b. to support the cantons in fulfilling their tasks in the fields of nature protection, cultural heritage protection and monument preservation, and to ensure cooperation with them;  
|    c. to support the endeavours of organisations active in the fields of nature protection, cultural heritage protection or monument preservation;  
|    d. to protect indigenous flora and fauna, their biological diversity and their natural habitats;  
|    d[bis]. to promote the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components through the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources;  
|    e. to promote science and research and the education and training of experts in the fields of nature protection, cultural heritage protection and monument preservation.

####### [Section 1 Nature Protection, Cultural Heritage Protection and Monument Preservation in the Fulfilment of Federal Tasks](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1)


###### [Fulfilment of federal tasks](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e6)

[**Art. 2**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_2) 

[1] The fulfilment of federal tasks as defined in Article 24[sexies] paragraph 2 of the Federal Constitution is taken to mean in particular:


|    a. the planning, construction and alteration of works and installations by the Confederation, its institutions and enterprises, such as buildings and installations of the federal administration, national roads, and buildings and installations of the Swiss Federal Railways;  
|    b. the issuing of licences and authorisations, such as those for the construction and operation of transport infrastructure and facilities (including approval of plans) and of works and installations for conveying energy, liquids or gases, and for telecommunications, as well as authorisations for forest-clearing operations;  
|    c. the provision of subsidies for planning, works and installations, e.g. for land improvement projects, renovation of agricultural buildings, river training, water body protection structures and transport infrastructure.

[2] Decisions of cantonal authorities concerning projects that can presumably be carried out only with subsidies as specified in paragraph 1*c* above shall be regarded as equivalent to the fulfilment of federal tasks.

###### [Obligations of the Confederation and cantons](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e8)

[**Art. 3**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_3) 

[1] In the fulfilment of federal tasks, the Confederation, its institutions and enterprises, and the cantons shall ensure that heritage landscapes and sites of local character, historical sites, and natural and cultural monuments are carefully managed and, where there is an overriding public interest, preserved undiminished.

[2] They shall fulfil this obligation by:


|    a. suitably designing and maintaining their own buildings and installations, or by foregoing their construction altogether (Art. 2 let. a);  
|    b. imposing conditions or requirements on the issue of licences and authorisations, or refusing to issue them (Art. 2 let. b);  
|    c. restricting or refusing subsidies (Art. 2 let. c).

[3] This obligation applies regardless of the significance of the site as defined in Article 4. A measure must not go beyond what is required to protect the site and its surroundings.

[4] ...

###### [Classification of sites](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e10)

[**Art. 4**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_4) 

With regard to heritage landscapes and sites of local character, historical sites, and natural and cultural monuments within the meaning of Article 24sexies paragraph 2 of the Federal Constitution, a distinction must be made between:


|    a. sites of national importance;  
|    b. sites of regional and local importance.

###### [Federal inventories of sites of national importance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e12)

[**Art. 5**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_5) 

[1] After consultation with the cantons, the Federal Council shall prepare inventories of sites of national importance; these may be based on existing inventories drawn up by official institutions and organisations active in the fields of nature protection, cultural heritage protection or monument preservation. The principles determining the selection of sites shall be stated in the inventories, which must also include at least the following details:


|    a. a precise description of the sites;  
|    b. justification for their national importance;  
|    c. possible threats;  
|    d. existing protection measures;  
|    e. the level of protection aimed for;  
|    f. proposals for improvements.

[2] The inventories need not be exhaustive. They must be reviewed and updated at regular intervals. Decisions on the inclusion, revision or deletion of sites shall be taken by the Federal Council after consultation with the cantons. The cantons may request a review on their own initiative.

###### [Importance of inclusion in an inventory](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e15)

[**Art. 6**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_6) 

[1] The inclusion of a site of national importance in a federal inventory indicates that it particularly deserves to be preserved undiminished, or in any case to be managed with the greatest possible care, including the application of restoration or appropriate replacement measures.

[2] In fulfilling a federal task, departures from the principle that sites are to be preserved undiminished, as specified in the inventories, may only be considered if opposing interests, also of national importance, carry equal or greater weight.

###### [Expert report prepared by commission](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e17)

[**Art. 7**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_7)

[1] If the Confederation is responsible for the fulfilment of a federal task, then, depending on its remit, either the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN), the Federal Office of Culture or the Federal Roads Office shall assess whether it is necessary for an expert report to be prepared by a commission as specified in Article 25 paragraph 1. If the canton is responsible, this assessment shall be made by the cantonal expert body as specified in Article 25 paragraph 2.

[2] If, in connection with the fulfilment of a federal task, a site listed in a federal inventory in accordance with Article 5 may be significantly damaged or fundamental issues are raised, the commission shall prepare an expert report for the decision-making authority, indicating whether the site should be preserved undiminished or how it must be protected.

[3] The expert report shall be one of the factors considered by the decision-making authority when weighing up all the interests.

###### [Optional expert report](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e19)

[**Art. 8**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_8)

In important cases, a commission may, on its own initiative, at any stage of the procedure, submit an expert report concerning the protection of sites or their preservation in an undiminished form. However, reports shall be submitted as early as possible. All necessary documentation shall be made available to the commission on request.

###### [Other expert reports](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e21)

[**Art. 9**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_9)

The competent federal body may also request the cantonal expert body (Art. 25 Para. 2), the cantonal commission responsible for nature protection, cultural heritage protection or monument preservation, or another body designated by the canton to prepare an expert report. In addition, it may request organisations active in the fields of nature protection, cultural heritage protection or monument preservation to submit their comments.

###### [Consultation of cantons](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e23)

[**Art. 10**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_10)

In all the cases specified in Articles 7, 8 and 9, the cantonal governments shall also be consulted. The cantons shall invite the communes concerned to state their position.

###### [Exception for military installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e25)

[**Art. 11**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#art_11) 

In the case of military buildings and installations not subject to approval in accordance with Article 126 paragraph 4 of the Armed Forces Act of 3 February 1995, the competent federal authority shall not be required to commission an expert report, nor is it obliged to provide documentation for the optional expert report.

###### [Right of appeal of communes and organi­sa­tions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1966/1637_1694_1679/en#lvl_d1638e3/chap_1/lvl_d1638e28)

[4] Financial assistance shall be provided only if the measures are cost-effective and are carried out professionally.

5 The protection and upkeep measures ordered constitute public-law restrictions on the use of property (Art. 702 Civil Code). They are binding on the landowner concerned and must be recorded in the land register on application by the canton. Exemptions from this obligation are determined by the Federal Council.
