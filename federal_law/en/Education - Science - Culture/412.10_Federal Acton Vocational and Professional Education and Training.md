[1] Responsibility for upper-secondary level vocational education and training (VET) and tertiary-level professional education shall be shared by the Confederation, the Cantons and professional organisations (social partners, trade associations as well as other organisations and education and training providers within the VPET system). They shall strive to ensure that there is an adequate number of training options within the VPET system, particularly in promising occupational and professional fields.

[2] The measures taken by the Confederation shall be designed to provide the Cantons and professional organisations with financial and other resources to encourage initiatives to the greatest extent possible.

[3] In order to fulfil the purpose of this Act:


|    a. the Confederation, the Cantons and professional organisations shall coordinate their activities;

## [Section 2 Structure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2003/674/en#chap_2/sec_2)

[**Art. 15** Subject matter](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2003/674/en#art_15) 

[1] VET programmes are intended to ensure the transfer and acquisition of upper secondary-level skills, knowledge and know-how (hereinafter referred to as competences) needed to carry out the tasks associated with an occupation, occupational field or field of activity (the latter two terms hereinafter referred to jointly as «occupational activity»).

[2] In particular, VET programmes include the transfer and acquisition of:


|    a. specific competences that learners require in order to carry out an occupational activity in a competent and confident manner;

[3] VET begins after a learner completes compulsory education or obtains an equivalent qualification. The Federal Council shall establish the criteria whereby a minimum age for commencement of VET may be set.

[4] The mandatory teaching of a second language is governed by VET ordinances.

[5] The teaching of physical education is governed by the Sport Promotion Act of 17 June 2011.

|    b. the classroom instruction segment is provided at VET schools and comprises both vocational and LCS subjects;  
|    c. the additional training segment is provided at branch training centres or third-party training centres for the purpose of complementing workplace training and classroom instruction segments.

[3] Using the requirements of the occupational activity as a frame of reference, the corresponding VET ordinance shall establish how the content of the VET programme shall be distributed across each of the three VET segments mentioned in paragraph 1, how the content will be structured and how much time will be devoted to each segment.

[4] Obligations to learners shall be determined by the apprenticeship contract. Where no apprenticeship contract has been signed, the corresponding obligations shall depend on the learning location.

[5] In order to achieve VET programme objectives, host companies, VET schools and branch training centres shall coordinate their activities.

[**Art. 17** Types and duration of VET programmes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2003/674/en#art_17)

[1] The duration of a VET programme may be shortened or lengthened to accommodate especially talented learners, learners who have already undergone relevant training, learners with learning difficulties and learners with disabilities.

[2] The Federal Council shall issue special provisions covering the individual tutoring of learners with learning difficulties in two-year VET programmes.

[3] The Confederation may provide funding to cover the costs of individual tutoring.

If no such agreement can be reached, the local cantonal authority shall decide. Learners may attend these courses without salary deduction.

[5] At the request of trade associations, SERI may authorise specialised courses to be offered at the intercantonal level if the following conditions are met: the courses enable training objectives to be reached more effectively, the courses increase host company willingness to provide workplace training within the framework of VET programmes, the course can be given without excessive additional cost and there are no significant disadvantages for participants.

[**Art. 23** Branch courses and similar third-party training courses](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2003/674/en#art_23) 

[1] Branch courses and similar third-party training courses are designed to enable the transfer and acquisition of basic know-how. These courses are intended to complement the workplace training and classroom instruction segments of VET programmes if such additional training meets the needs of the occupational activity.

[2] Working with professional organisations, the Cantons shall ensure that an adequate number of branch courses or similar third-party training courses are made available.

[3] Attendance of branch courses is mandatory. At the request of the host company, the Cantons may free learners from their obligation to attend a branch course if the course content is already covered by another course that the learner is attending in a company training centre or upper-secondary level trade school.

[4] Anyone who organises branch courses or similar third-party training courses may ask the host companies or VET school involved to pay a proportionate share of the costs. In order to avoid competitive distortions, professional organisations that organise branch courses or similar third-party training courses may ask non-member companies to pay a higher share of the costs.

[6] Companies whose contribution to VPET costs is already included in their membership fees to the professional organisation or companies that are able to demonstrate that they already provide commensurate VET, professional education and/or job-related CET courses, shall not be required to make payments into the VPET fund that has been declared mandatory for all other companies within the given economic branch.

[7] SERI shall be responsible for overall supervision of mandatory VPET funds. SERI shall issue an ordinance to regulate the accounting and auditing aspects of such funds.
