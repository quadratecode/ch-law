## [Section 2 Tasks, Promotion Principles and Contributions of the Research Funding Institutions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/786/en#chap_2/sec_2)


[**Art. 9** Tasks and promotion principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/786/en#art_9) 

[1] The research funding institutions perform tasks that, in practice, need to be carried out within the scope of scientific self-governance.

[2] They promote research which does not directly serve commercial purposes.

[3] They promote research in accordance with their own statutes and regulations. These require the approval of the Federal Council, insofar as they cover activities for which federal funding is used. The research funding institutions may delegate the task of issuing implementing provisions of minor importance to the statutes and regulations requiring approval to subsidiary bodies. These provision do not require approval.

[4] The research funding institutions place particular emphasis on the promotion of basic research.

[5] They promote research in non-commercial research institutes outside the higher education sector according to the following requirements:


|    a. the scientific independence of the persons in charge of the implementation of research is ensured;  
|    b. the research serves the education and training of young researchers;  
|    c. the results will be made available to the scientific public.

[**Art. 10** Swiss National Science Foundation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/786/en#art_10) 

[1] The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) is the Confederation’s funding body for research in all academic disciplines that are represented at a higher education research centre.

[2] It uses the contributions granted by the Confederation for, in particular:


|    a. research funding within the framework of the research instruments that it has set up;  
|    b. funding programmes and networked research projects at national and international level that it has decided to participate in;  
|    c. implementing national funding programmes which have been approved and commissioned by the Federal Council, particularly the National Research Programmes and the National Centres of Competence in Research;  
|    d. supporting Switzerland’s participation in international programmes which have been approved and commissioned by the Federal Council;  
|    e. supporting measures for the evaluation and exploitation of results of research which it has encouraged.

[3] Within its remit and responsibilities, it decides on suitable instruments and the type of funding. In so doing, it focuses on the funding of:


|    a. excellent research projects;  
|    b. highly qualified young researchers;  
|    c. research infrastructures which serve the development of fields of expertise in Switzerland and which are not within the remit of the higher education research centres or the Confederation;  
|    d. international research cooperation in accordance with the Confederation’s relevant goals and measures.

[4] In the context of its support for higher education research centres and non-commercial research centres outside the higher education sector, it pays contributions in order to compensate for indirect research costs (overheads) which are incurred. The Federal Council regulates the principles for calculating the contributions.

[5] The SNSF participates in the procedures that precede the decisions on the National Research Programmes, the National Centres of Competence in Research and further funding programmes which are assigned to it.

[6] In order to ensure the continuity of its research funding, it may use part of the funding provided by the Confederation to build up equity in the form of reserves. In any financial year, the total of the reserves may not exceed 10 per cent of the concurrent annual funding provided by the Confederation.

[7] Based on the financing decisions of the Federal Assembly, the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) periodically draws up a service level agreement with the SNSF. In this agreement, additional tasks conferred by the Federal Council are also specified.

[**Art. 11** Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/786/en#art_11)

|    a. conducting and promoting the early recognition of themes relevant to society in education, research and innovation;  
|    b. striving to ensure that whoever makes or applies scientific discoveries assumes their ethical responsibilities;  
|    c. encouraging dialogue between the world of science and society; it promotes studies on the opportunities and risks of innovations and technologies.

[3] The academies coordinate their research funding activities in the context of the association and in particular ensure collaboration with higher education research centres.

[4] They promote collaboration among scientists and experts in specialist bodies, commissions and other suitable organisational forms and use these to perform their tasks.

[5] They support international scientific collaboration by funding or running suitable institutions, in particular national coordination platforms and scientific administrative offices for internationally coordinated programmes in which Switzerland participates.

[6] They may support data collections, documentation systems, scientific journals, publications, or similar institutions, which serve as useful infrastructures for the development of fields of expertise in Switzerland and which do not come under the remit of the SNSF or the higher education research centres or do not receive direct support from the Confederation.

[7] Based on the financing decisions of the Federal Assembly, SERI periodically enters into a service level agreement with the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. In this document, the association and the individual academies may be assigned with evaluations under paragraphs 1–4, with the implementation of scientific projects, the operation of institutions under paragraph 6 and other special tasks.

[**Art. 12** Scientific integrity and good scientific practice; sanctions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/786/en#art_12) 

[1] The research funding institutions ensure that research which they support conforms to the rules of scientific integrity and good scientific practice.

[2] If they have good reason to believe that these rules are being breached, they may, within their promotion and controlling mechanisms, obtain information from national or foreign institutions or persons concerned and provide information to such institutions or persons.
