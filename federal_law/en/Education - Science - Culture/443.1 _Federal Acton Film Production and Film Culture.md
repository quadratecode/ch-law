[1] Distribution and projection companies must contribute in their activities to the diversity of films on offer by means of:


|    a. their business policy;  
|    b. measures agreed within the industry.

[2] The measures include agreements in which distribution and projection companies or their professional associations undertake to organise the programming for a cinema region to provide as much diversity and quality as possible.

[3] Before entering into an agreement within the industry, the associations involved shall consult the FDHA on the measures planned to promote the diversity of the films on offer and linguistic diversity.

[**Art. 18** Diversity of films on offer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2002/283/en#art_18) 

The diversity of films on offer in a cinema region is guaranteed if the films on offer, given the number of screens used and the size of the cinema region, originate in sufficient numbers from a variety of countries, are of a variety of genres and represent a variety of film styles.

[**Art. 19** Linguistic diversity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2002/283/en#art_19) 

[1] Films subsidised by the Confederation must be made available in more than one national language.

[**Art. 20** Assessment and re-establishment of diversity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2002/283/en#art_20) 

[1] The Federal Office regularly assesses the effect of the activities and measures in accordance with Article 17 on the basis of the information received in terms of Article 24 periodically. It publishes the results of the assessment and allows the industry, and in particular the promotion organisations that are party to agreements in terms of Article 17 paragraph 3, the opportunity to state its views.

[2] If the Federal Office establishes in the course of the assessment that the diversity of films on offer in a cinema region is inadequate, it shall require the distribution and projection companies concerned to take measures within a reasonable time to re-establish the diversity of films.

[3] In relation to distribution and projection companies that have entered into an agreement in terms of Article 17 paragraph 3, the instructions are issued to the promotion organisation. This shall take the required measures independently in order to re-establish the diversity of films on offer within a reasonable time.

[4] The tax may be levied for as long as is required to re-establish the position required by the law.

[**Art. 22** Exemptions from the tax](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2002/283/en#art_22) 

[1] Distribution and projection companies may secure exemption from payment of the tax by making a formal undertaking to the Confederation to make a special contribution to the diversity and quality of the films on offer in a cinema region.

[2] In the event of wilful non-compliance with the undertaking in terms of paragraph 1, the tax becomes due for payment without any further formalities.
