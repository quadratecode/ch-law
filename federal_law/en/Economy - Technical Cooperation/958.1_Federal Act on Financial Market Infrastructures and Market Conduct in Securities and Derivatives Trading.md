[5] Each person must notify FINMA before directly or indirectly acquiring or disposing of a qualified participation in accordance with paragraph 4 in a financial market infrastructure organised under Swiss law. This notification duty also applies if a qualified participation is increased or reduced in such a way as to reach, exceed or fall below the thresholds of 20%, 33% or 50% of the share capital or votes.

[6] The financial market infrastructure shall notify FINMA of the persons who meet the conditions of paragraph 5 as soon as it becomes aware of the same. It must submit a list of its qualified participants to FINMA at least once a year.

|    a. at least one of them operates as a financial market infrastructure;  
|    b. they operate primarily in the financial sector; and

## [Chapter 3 Central Counterparties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#tit_2/chap_3)

### [Section 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_1)

[**Art. 48** Definition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_48) 

A central counterparty is an entity based on uniform rules and procedures that interposes itself between the counterparties to a securities transaction or other contract involving financial instruments, thereby becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.

[**Art. 49** Collateral](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_49) 

[1] The central counterparty shall require its participants to provide appropriate collateral, particularly in the form of initial margins, variation margins and default fund contributions.

[2] This collateral shall be calculated at least in such a way that:


|    a. a participant's variation margins cover the current credit exposures based on realised market price movements;  
|    b. a participant's initial margins will, with a high degree of confidence, cover the potential credit exposures arising for a central counterparty upon the participant's default based on expected market price movements;  
|    c. the initial margins, variation margins and default fund contributions will be sufficient to cover the loss resulting under extreme but plausible market conditions from the default of the participant to which the central counterparty has its greatest exposure.

[3] The central counterparty shall accept only liquid collateral with low credit and market risks. It shall value the collateral prudently.

[**Art. 50** Fulfilment of payment obligations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_50) 

[1] The central counterparty and its participants shall fulfil their mutual payment obligations by transferring sight deposits held with a central bank.

[1] The central counterparty must have sufficient liquidity:


|    a. to fulfil its payment obligations in all currencies under extreme but plausible market conditions, even in the event of the default of the participant to which it has its greatest exposure; and  
|    b. to be able to duly execute its services and activities.

[2] It shall invest its financial resources solely in cash or in liquid financial instruments with a low market and credit risk.

[**Art. 53** Procedure in the event of the default of a participant](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_53) 

[1] The central counterparty shall take measures to limit the credit and liquidity risks in the event of a participant's default. 

[2] To cover any losses in the event of a participant's default, it shall use collateral and capital in the following order:


|    a. margins of the defaulting participant;  
|    b. default fund contributions of the defaulting participant;  
|    c. dedicated capital of the central counterparty;  
|    d. default fund contributions of non-defaulting participants.

[3] It shall issue rules governing how more extensive losses are to be covered. It may not:


|    a. use the initial margins of non-defaulting participants to cover losses caused by the default of another participant;  
|    b. use the collateral of indirect participants to cover losses caused by the default of a participant or other indirect participant; or  
|    c. use an indirect participant's funds in excess of the margin requirement deposited with it in accordance with Article 59 paragraph 3 to cover losses caused by the default of a participant or other indirect participant.

[**Art. 54** Segregation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_54) 

[1] The central counterparty must: 


|    a. separate its own assets, receivables and liabilities from the collateral, receivables and liabilities of its participants; and  
|    b. separate a participant's collateral, receivables and liabilities from those of other participants.

[2] It shall offer its participants the possibility of:


|    a. separating their own collateral, receivables and liabilities from those of indirect participants;  
|    b. keeping and recording the collateral, receivables and liabilities of indirect participants together (omnibus customer accounts) or separately (individual customer accounts).

[**Art. 55** Portability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_55) 

[1] The central counterparty shall ensure that, in the event of a participant's default, the collateral and positions held by the participant on behalf of an indirect participant can be transferred to another participant indicated by the indirect participant.

[2] A participant shall be considered to be in default if:


|    a. it does not meet the admission requirements concerning the participant's financial capacity by the deadline set by the central counterparty; or  
|    b. compulsory winding-up proceedings were initiated against it for the purposes of general execution.

|    d. the central counterparties are authorised or recognised by FINMA;  
|    e. the authorities responsible for supervising and overseeing the foreign central counterparty collaborate with the competent Swiss authorities.

[3] If a central counterparty involved in the interoperability agreement is systemically important, FINMA shall obtain the SNB's agreement before granting its approval.

[4] If a central counterparty involved in an interoperability agreement extends its activity to a new trading venue without this entailing new risks, the interoperability agreement does not require re-approval. 

### [Section 3 Participants](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_3)

[2] It shall offer indirect participants the possibility of keeping and recording the collateral, receivables and liabilities together with those of other indirect participants (omnibus customer accounts) or separately (individual customer accounts).

[3] If an indirect participant opts for individual client segregation, the participant must deposit all funds in excess of the indirect participant's margin requirement with the central counterparty and distinguish them from the margin of other indirect participants.

[4] A central counterparty's participant shall publish the costs and specifics concerning the level of protection granted by the type of account management under paragraph 2.

### [Section 4 Recognition of Foreign Central Counterparties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_4)

[**Art. 60**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_60)

|    b. provides services for a Swiss financial market infrastructure;  
|    c. enters into an interoperability agreement with a Swiss central counterparty.

[2] FINMA shall grant recognition:


|    a. if the foreign central counterparty is subject to appropriate regulation and supervision; and

|    c. the independence of the self-regulatory organisation (Art. 27 para. 2) and of the appeal body (Art. 37 para. 1).

[2] DLT trading facilities are deemed to be small if they pose a low risk in terms of the protection of financial market participants and the proper functioning and stability of the financial system, in particular because the number of participants, the trading volume, the volume of custody assets or the clearing and settlement volume is limited. The Federal Council shall set thresholds.

[3] DLT-Handelssysteme, die Erleichterungen nach diesem Artikel erhalten, sind verpflichtet, dies gegenüber ihren Kundinnen und Kunden offenzulegen. Der Bundesrat regelt die Details.

[**Art. 89** System protection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_89) 

[1] Insofar as this is possible and to the extent that they are concerned, FINMA shall inform central counterparties, central securities depositories, payment systems and those DLT trading facilities that provide comparable central custody, clearing or settlement services, in Switzerland and abroad, of the insolvency measures it intends to take against a participant and which limit the participant's power of disposal. It shall also inform them of the precise time of entry into effect of the measures.

[2] The orders given to a central counterparty, central securities depository, payment system or a DLT trading facility that provides comparable central custody, clearing or settlement services by a participant against which such an insolvency measure has been taken shall be legally enforceable and binding on third parties if:

a. they were introduced before the measure was ordered and were unalterable in accordance with the rules of the financial market infrastructure; or

[**Art. 97** Clearing duty](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_97) 

[1] Counterparties must clear transactions in derivatives in accordance with Article 101 that were not conducted via a trading venue (OTC derivatives transactions) through a central counterparty authorised or recognised by FINMA.

[2] This duty does not apply to transactions with small counterparties or for transactions between such counterparties.

[3] A counterparty may assume that its counterparty's declaration concerning its characteristics is correct insofar as there are no indications to the contrary.

[4] In order to complement the duty detailed in Article 112, the Federal Council may order that all derivatives transactions conducted via a trading venue or organised trading facility must be cleared by a central counterparty authorised or recognised by FINMA.

[5] FINMA may allow clearing by an unrecognised central counterparty in individual cases, provided this does not adversely affect the protective purpose of this Act.

[**Art. 98** Small non-financial counterparties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_98) 

[1] A non-financial counterparty is deemed to be small if all of the rolling averages for its gross positions in relevant outstanding OTC derivatives transactions calculated over 30 working days are below the thresholds. 

[2] If one of the average gross positions of an existing small non-financial counterparty calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 exceeds the relevant threshold, said counterparty will no longer be deemed small four months after the threshold is exceeded. 

[3] Derivatives transactions intended to reduce risks are not factored into the calculation of the average gross position if they are directly associated with the business activity, liquidity management or asset management of the counterparty or group.

[**Art. 99** Small financial counterparties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_99) 

[1] A financial counterparty is deemed to be small if the rolling average for its gross position in all outstanding OTC derivatives transactions calculated over 30 working days is below the threshold.

[2] If an existing small financial counterparty's average gross position in accordance with paragraph 1 exceeds the threshold, said counterparty will no longer be deemed small four months after the threshold is exceeded.

[**Art. 100** Thresholds](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_100) 

[1] Thresholds apply by derivatives category to non-financial counterparties' average gross positions in outstanding OTC derivatives transactions.

[2] A single threshold shall apply to the average gross positions in all outstanding OTC derivatives transactions of financial counterparties.

[3] If the counterparty is part of a fully consolidated group, all of the intra-group OTC derivatives transactions concluded by the counterparty or by other counterparties shall also be factored into the calculation of the average gross positions.

[4] The Federal Council shall determine:


|    a. for non-financial counterparties, the level of the thresholds for each derivatives category and how they are calculated;  
|    b. which derivatives transactions of non-financial counterparties are not to be taken into account when calculating the thresholds;  
|    c. the threshold for financial counterparties.

[**Art. 101** Derivatives concerned](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_101) 

[1] FINMA determines the derivatives which must be cleared via a central counterparty. In so doing, it considers:


|    a. their degree of legal and operational standardisation;  
|    b. their liquidity;  
|    c. their trading volumes;  
|    d. the availability of pricing information in the given category;  
|    e. the counterparty risks associated with them.

[2] It shall take account of recognised international standards and foreign legal developments. It may phase in the introduction of the clearing duty by derivatives category.

[3] No clearing duty may be imposed for:


|    a. derivatives that are not cleared by any authorised or recognised central counterparty;  
|    b. currency swaps and forward transactions, provided they are settled on a payment versus payment basis.

[**Art. 102** Cross-border transactions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_102) 

The duty to clear through a central counterparty also applies if the foreign counterparty of the Swiss counterparty subject to this duty would be subject to the clearing duty if it had its registered office in Switzerland. 

[**Art. 103** Intra-group transactions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_103) 

Derivatives transactions do not have to be cleared via a central counterparty:


|    a. if the two counterparties are included in the same full consolidation basis;   
|    b. if the two counterparties are subject to appropriate centralised risk evaluation, measurement and control procedures; and  
|    c. if the transactions do not aim to circumvent the clearing duty.

### [Section 3 Reporting to a Trade Repository](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#tit_3/chap_1/sec_3)

[**Art. 104** Reporting duty](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_104) 

[1] Derivatives transactions must be reported to a trade repository authorised or recognised by FINMA.

[2] The following shall be obliged to report:


|    a. in the case of transactions between a financial and a non-financial counterparty: the financial counterparty;  
|    b. in the case of transactions between two financial counterparties:  
|    1. the financial counterparty which is not small in accordance with Article 99,  
|    2. the selling counterparty in the case of a transaction between two financial counterparties or between two small financial counterparties;


|    c. the counterparty which has its registered office in Switzerland if the foreign counterparty does not report.

[3] In the event of a transaction between non-financial counterparties, paragraph[]2 letters b and c applies by analogy. A transaction between small non-financial counterparties does not have to be reported.

[4] If the transaction is cleared centrally, the report is submitted by the central counterparty. If a recognised foreign central counterparty does not submit reports, the reporting duty shall remain with the counterparties. 

[5] Third parties may be involved in reporting.

[6] If there is no trade repository, the Federal Council shall indicate the body to which the report is to be submitted.

[**Art. 105** Timing and content of reports](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_105)

[2] For each transaction, the following must be reported as a minimum:

[**Art. 106** Retention of supporting documents](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_106) 

Counterparties must retain the supporting documents for their derivatives transactions in accordance with the provisions of Article 958*f* CO.

|    b. have procedures for reconciling portfolios and managing the associated risks, except for when the counterparty is a small non-financial counterparty;  
|    c. have procedures for identifying and resolving disputes between parties at an early stage;  
|    d. regularly, but at least twice per year, perform portfolio compression where this is appropriate to mitigate their counterparty risk and provided they have 500 or more non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives transactions outstanding.

[**Art. 109** Valuation of outstanding transactions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/en#art_109) 

[1] Counterparties must value derivatives at current prices (mark to market) on a daily basis.

[2] This duty does not apply to transactions with small counterparties.

[4] Non-financial counterparties may involve third parties for the valuation.

|    b. their liquidity;  
|    c. their trading volumes;  
|    d. the availability of pricing information in the given category;
