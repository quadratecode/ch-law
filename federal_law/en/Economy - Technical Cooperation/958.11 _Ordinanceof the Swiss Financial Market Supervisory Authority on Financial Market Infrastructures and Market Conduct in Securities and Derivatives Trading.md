[1] The derivatives categories to be cleared via a central counterparty are listed in Annex 1.

[2] The decision whether to list derivatives categories in Annex 1 is based on whether:


|    a. the contract conditions contain the usual legal documents for the sector with the usual contract specifications listed by counterparties;  
|    b. the operational processes are subject to automated post-trade processing and there are standardised lifecycle events managed in accordance with a generally agreed schedule;

|    d. the size and depth of the product's market are stable over the long term;  
|    e. if a participant in a central counterparty defaults, the market segmentation remains sufficiently high;  
|    f. the number and value of the previously concluded transactions are sufficiently high;  
|    g. the information required for the formation of prices is readily available on normal commercial conditions;  
|    h. there is a heightened systemic risk that counterparties may be unable to meet their payment and delivery obligations to each other if there are strong interdependencies between them.

[2] If the central counterparty clears additional derivatives categories subsequently to obtaining a licence or recognition, it shall inform FINMA thereof.

[3] Upon request it must deliver all information to FINMA necessary to determine the derivatives categories subject to the clearingobligation.

# [Chapter 5 Disclosure of Shareholdings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#chap_5)

## [Section 1 Notification Duty](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#chap_5/sec_1)

[**Art. 10** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_10) 

(Art. 120 paras. 1 and 3, 123 para. 1 FinMIA)

[1] The beneficial owners of equity securities under Article 120 paragraph 1 FinMIA are subject to the notification duty. A beneficial owner is the party controlling the voting rights stemming from a shareholding and bearing the associated economic risk. 

[2] If the voting rights are not exercised directly or indirectly by the beneficial owner, any person who has full discretionary powers to exercise the voting rights is also subject to the notification duty in accordance with Article 120 para. 3 FinMIA. If the person who has full discretionary powers to exercise voting rights is directly or indirectly controlled, their notification duty is met where the controlling person reports on a consolidated basis. In such case, the controlling person is considered to be subject to the notification duty.

[3] There is no notification duty, if:


|    a. notification of reaching a threshold was provided and that threshold is exceeded, without the subsequent threshold being reached or exceeded;  
|    b. notification of reaching or exceeding a threshold was provided and that threshold is met again, without having reached or exceeded the subsequent threshold;  
|    c. a threshold is temporarily reached, exceeded or fallen below during a trading day.

[**Art. 11** Indirect acquisition and indirect disposal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_11) 

(Art. 120 para. 5, 123 para. 1 FinMIA)

The following cases in particular qualify as an indirect acquisition or indirect disposal of a shareholding:


|    a. the acquisition and disposal via a third party in their own name and on behalf of the beneficial owner;  
|    b. the acquisition and disposal through directly or indirectly controlled legal entities;  
|    c. the acquisition and disposal of a shareholding which directly or indirectly transfers control of a legal entity which directly or indirectly holds equity securities.

[**Art. 12** Acting in concert or as an organised group](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_12) 

(Art. 120 para. 1, 121, 123 para. 1 FinMIA)

[1] Any party who coordinates their conduct regarding the acquisition or disposal of shareholdings or the exercising of voting rights with third parties by contract, other organised arrangement or by law, is acting in concert or as an organised group.

[2] Acquisitions and disposals between persons who are acting in concert or as an organised group and have disclosed their total shareholding are exempt from the notification duty.

[3] Changes in the composition of the group and the nature of the arrangement or of the group must be reported.

[**Art. 13** Triggering of the notification duty](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_13) 

(Art. 120 paras. 1, 3 and 4, 123 para. 1 FinMIA)

[1] The notification duty under Article 120 paragraph 1 FinMIA is triggered by the emergence of the claim to acquire or dispose of equity securities (binding transaction), irrespective of whether this claim is conditional. The indication of an intended acquisition or disposal does not trigger a notification duty, provided there are no legal obligations associated therewith.

[2] The triggering of the notification duty at the time of the binding transaction under paragraph 1 and an associated disconnection of beneficial owner status and voting entitlement, do not trigger a separate notification duty under Article 120 paragraph 3 FinMIA either for the acquirer or the person disposing of the shareholding.

[3] If a threshold is reached, exceeded or fallen below of as a result of a company with registered office in Switzerland increasing, decreasing of restructuring its share capital, the notification duty is triggered by the correspondent publication in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce. In the case of companies with registered office abroad whose equity securities are mainly listed in whole or in part in Switzerland the notification duty is triggered by the publication in accordance with Article 115 paragraph 3 FinMIO.

[**Art. 14** Calculation of the positions requiring notification](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_14) 

(Art. 120 paras. 1 and 3, 123 para. 1 FinMIA)

[1] Any person who reaches, exceeds or falls short of a threshold in one or both of the positions below, must calculate the positions individually and separately and report them simultaneously:


|    a. acquisition positions:  
|    1. shares and equity-related units and voting rights under Article 120 paragraph 3 FinMIA,  
|    2. conversion and acquisition rights (Art. 15 para. 2 let. a),

[2] The positions requiring notification shall be calculated for companies with registered office in Switzerland based on the total number of voting rights in accordance with the entry in the commercial register. The calculation of the positions requiring notification for companies with registered office abroad shall be based on the publication in accordance with Article 115 paragraph 3 FinMIO.

[**Art. 15** Equity derivatives](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_15) 

(Art. 120 paras. 1, 4 and 5, 123 para. 1 FinMIA)

|    c. equity derivatives designed for or permitting cash settlement as well as other contracts for difference, including *financial futures*.

[3] The exercise or non-exercise of equity derivatives reported under paragraph 2 must be reported again if it leads to one of the thresholds under Article 120 paragraph 1 FinMIA being reached, exceeded or fallen below.

[**Art. 16** Other facts requiring notification](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_16) 

(Art. 120 paras. 1 and 4, 123 para. 1 FinMIA)

[1] A notification duty applies in particular when one of the thresholds under Article 120 paragraph 1 FinMIA is achieved, exceeded or fallen below of:


|    a. due to an increase, decrease or restructuring of share capital;  
|    b. due to the acquisition or disposal of proprietary equity securities by a company;  
|    c. due to the acquisition and disposal of equity securities for in-house funds in accordance with Article 71 of the Financial Services Act of 15 June 2018 (FinSA);  
|    d. through the proportion of voting rights in the acquisition positions in accordance with Article 14 paragraph 1 letter a 1, alone, whether exercisable or not and regardless of whether the total proportion of voting rights including equity derivatives under Article 15 reaches, exceeds or falls below a threshold;  
|    e. when transferring equity securities by virtue of the law or following a court or authority ruling.

[2] Changes in information under Article 22 paragraphs 1 letters d and e, 2 letters c, d and f and 3 again trigger a notification duty.

[**Art. 17** Securities lending and similar transactions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_17) 

(Art. 120 para. 1, 123 para. 1 FinMIA)

[1] Lending transactions and similar transactions, such as repurchase agreements or collateral transactions with transfer of ownership must be reported.

[2] The notification duty is only incumbent on the contracting party acquiring temporary ownership of the securities through such transactions:


|    a. for lending transactions: the borrower;  
|    b. for repurchase agreements: the buyer; and  
|    c. for collateral transactions: the collateral taker.

[3] On expiry of the transaction, the returning contracting party under paragraph 2 is again subject to a notification duty if a threshold in accordance with Article 120 paragraph 1 FinMIA is reached or fallen below.

[4] Lending transactions and repurchase agreements do not need to be reported if they are processed in a standardised manner via trading platforms for liquidity management purposes.

[4] For foreign collective investment schemes not approved for offer which depend on a group of companies, the reporting requirements in Article 120 paragraph 1 FinMIA are met by the group.

# [Chapter 6 Duty to make an Offer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#chap_6)

## [Section 1 Duty to make an Offer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#chap_6/sec_1)

[**Art. 30** Applicable provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_30) 

(Art. 135 para. 4 FinMIA)

In addition to Art. 135 FinMIA and the following provisions, Articles 125–134, 136–141, 152 and 163 FinMIA and the implementing provisions of the Federal Council and Takeover Board pertaining to public takeover offers apply to the duty to make an offer.

[**Art. 31** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_31) 

(Art. 135 paras. 1 and 4 FinMIA)

The duty to make an offer is incumbent on any person who acquires equity securities directly or indirectly and, by doing so, exceeds the legal or statutory threshold under Article 135 paragraph 1 FinMIA (threshold).

[**Art. 32** Indirect acquisition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_32) 

(Art. 135 paras. 1 and 4 FinMIA)

Article 120 paragraph 5 FinMIA and Article 11 of this Ordinance apply by analogy to those holdings of the target company requiring an offer when making an indirect acquisition.

[**Art. 33** Acting in concert or as an organised group](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_33) 

(Art. 135 paras. 1 and 4, 136 para. 2 FinMIA)

Article 12 paragraph 1 applies to persons acting in concert or as an organised group to acquire holdings requiring an offer with respect to the target company with the aim of controlling the target company.

[**Art. 34** Calculation of the threshold](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_34) 

(Art. 135 paras. 1 and 4 FinMIA)

[1] The threshold is calculated based on the total number of voting rights in accordance with the entry in the commercial register.

[2] When determining whether the threshold has been exceeded, all equity securities are taken into account which are owned by the acquiring person or whose voting rights have been transferred to the acquiring person in another way, regardless of whether the voting rights may be exercised.

[3] Voting rights restricted to a power of attorney granted solely for the purposes of representation at one general meeting are excluded from the calculation.

[**Art. 35** Definition of the duty to make an offer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_35) 

(Art. 135 paras. 1 and 4 FinMIA)

[1] The duty to make an offer must be extended to all types of listed equity securities of the target company.

[2] It must also include new equity securities created through equity derivatives, if the associated rights are exercised prior to expiry of the extension under Article 130 paragraph 2 FinMIA.

[**Art. 36** Transfer of the duty to make an offer to the acquiring person](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_36) 

(Art. 135 para. 4, 136 para. 2, 163 FinMIA)

If the person previously entitled to the equity securities was subject to the duty to make an offer for all equity securities on exceeding the threshold of 50% of voting rights pursuant to the transitional regulation of Article 163 FinMIA, this duty passes over to the person acquiring a holding between 33⅓ and 50% of the voting rights, if that person is exempted from the duty to make an offer under Article 136 paragraph 2 FinMIA.

[**Art. 37** Resurgence of the duty to make an offer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_37) 

(Art. 135 para. 4 FinMIA)

A person who reduces a holding of 50% or more of the voting rights in a company acquired prior to 1 January 1998 to under 50% must make an offer under Article 135 FinMIA, if the said person's holding subsequently exceeds the threshold of 50%. 

[**Art. 38** Duty to make an offer and conditions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_38) 

(Art. 135 paras. 1 and 4, 136 para. 2 FinMIA)

[1] The duty to make an offer may not be made subject to conditions unless there is good cause for doing so.

[2] Good cause is particularly present if:


|    a. an official authorisation is required for the acquisition;  
|    b. the equity securities to be acquired do not procure voting rights; or  
|    c. the offeror wants the specifically mentioned economic substance of the target company to remain unchanged.

[**Art. 39** Time period](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_39) 

(Art. 135 paras. 1 and 4 FinMIA)

[1] The mandatory offer must be made within two months of exceeding the threshold.

[2] The Takeover Board may grant an extension if there is good cause for doing so.

## [Section 2 Exceptions to the Duty to make an Offer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#chap_6/sec_2)

[**Art. 40** General exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_40) 

(Art. 135 para. 4, 136 FinMIA)

[1] The duty to make an offer lapses, if:


|    a. the threshold is exceeded during a restructuring resulting from a capital reduction immediately followed by a capital increase for the purpose of offsetting a loss;  
|    b. banks or securities firms under FinIA acting independently or as a syndicate acquire equity securities as part of an issue and undertake to sell the number of equity securities exceeding the threshold within three months after exceeding the threshold and the sale actually takes place within this period.

[2] The claim to an exception under paragraph 1 or Article 136 paragraph 2 FinMIA has to be notified to the Takeover Board. The Takeover Board shall initiate an administrative procedure within five trading days if it has reason to suspect that the conditions in paragraph 1 are not met.

[3] The Takeover Board may extend the period under paragraph 1 letter b upon application if there is adequate justification for doing so.

[**Art. 41** Particular exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_41) 

(Art. 135, 136 para. 1 FinMIA)

[1] In the cases outlined under Article 136 paragraph 1 FinMIA and in other justified cases, a person obliged to make an offer may be exempted from the duty to make an offer if there is good cause for doing so.

[2] Further justified cases under Article 136 paragraph 1 FinMIA are particularly those cases where:


|    a. the acquiring person cannot control the target company because another person or group has a higher voting share;  
|    b. a member of an organised group in accordance with Article 136 paragraph 1 letter a FinMIA exceeds the threshold individually; or  
|    c. the previous acquisition was made indirectly (Art. 32), provided this acquisition is not one of the main purposes of the transaction and the interests of the target company's shareholders remain preserved.

[3]When granting exceptions conditions may be attached; in particular the acquiring person may be made subject to certain obligations.

[4] The conditions under paragraph 3 transfer to a legal successor who acquires a shareholding exceeding 33⅓% even if the legal successor is exempt from the duty to make an offer under Article 136 paragraph 2 FinMIA.

## [Section 3 Determining the Offer Price](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#chap_6/sec_3)

[**Art. 42** Stock exchange price](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_42) 

(Art. 135 paras. 2–4 FinMIA)

[1] The offer price must be at least equal to the stock exchange price for every type of equity security in the target company.

[2] The stock exchange price in accordance with Article 135 paragraph 2 letter a FinMIA corresponds to the volume-weighted average price of the on-order-book trades of the last 60 trading days prior to the publication of the offer or to the pre-announcement.

[3] It must be adjusted to negate the effects of significant price influences triggered by special events, such as a dividend distribution or capital transactions, to which it is subject during this period. An audit firm in accordance with Article 128 paragraph 1 FinMIA must confirm the adequacy of the adjustment and show the calculation basis in its report.

[4] If the listed equity securities are not liquid prior to the publication of the offer or the pre-announcement, the audit firm has to carry out a valuation of the company. The report shall outline the valuation methods and the basis for the valuation as well as provide an explanation of whether and, if so, to what extent, the setting of the minimum price is to deviate from the stock exchange price or company value.

[**Art. 43** Price of the previous acquisition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_43) 

(Art. 135 paras. 2–4 FinMIA)

[1] The price of the previous acquisition under Article 135 paragraph 2 letter b FinMIA corresponds to the highest price paid by the buyer for equity securities in the target company over the past 12 months prior the to publication of the offer or to the pre-announcement.

[2] It must be defined separately for each type of equity security. The price of the most expensive equity security relative to the nominal value shall form the basis for setting the appropriate ratio between the prices of different types of equity securities under Article 135 paragraph 3 FinMIA.

[3] The equity securities in the target company acquired through the exchange of securities as part of the previous acquisition shall be calculated at their value at the time of the exchange.

[4] If the person buying or selling has added other benefits in addition to the main payment for the previous acquisition, and in particular if the person has provided guarantees or benefits in kind, the price for the previous purchase shall be reduced or increased correspondingly.

[5] An audit firm (Art. 128 FinMIA) must review the valuation of the equity securities under paragraph 3 and the adequacy of the increase or decrease under paragraph 4 and present its calculation details in its report.

[**Art. 44** Indirect prior acquisition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_44) 

(Art. 135 paras. 2–4 FinMIA)

[1] If the prior acquisition was indirect within the meaning of Article 32 in conjunction with Article 11 letter c, the offeror must disclose in the offer prospectus the share of the total price paid attributable to the target company's equity securities.

[2] The valuation of this share must be audited by an audit firm.

[**Art. 45** Payment of the offer price](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_45) 

(Art. 135 paras. 2–4 FinMIA)

[1] The offer price may be paid in cash or exchanged against securities.

[2] Payment against exchange of securities is permitted provided full payment in cash is offered as an alternative.

[**Art. 46** Valuation of securities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_46) 

(Art. 135 paras. 2–4 FinMIA)

Article 42 paragraphs 2–4 apply to determining the value of the securities offered in exchange.

[**Art. 47** Exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/855/en#art_47) 

(Art. 135 paras. 2–4 FinMIA)

The Takeover Board may grant exemptions from the regulations of this section (Art. 40–44) to the offeror in individual cases if there is good cause for doing so.

[3] A disclosure office that does not have an electronic publishing platform when this Ordinance comes into force must have such a platform available and fully operational by 1 January 2017.

[4] Until an electronic publishing platform becomes operational in accordance with paragraph 3, the company publishes its disclosure notifications in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce and in at least one of the prominent electronic media used for disseminating stock exchange information. The relevant point in time in determining compliance with the deadline under Article 24 paragraph 2 is the communication of the disclosure notification to the electronic media. Such disclosure notification must be sent to the disclosure office at the same time.
