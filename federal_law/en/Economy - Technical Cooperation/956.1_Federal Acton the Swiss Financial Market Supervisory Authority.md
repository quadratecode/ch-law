[3] The transmission of information that is of substantial importance in accordance with Article 29 paragraph 2 must be reported to FINMA beforehand. 

[4] FINMA may reserve administrative assistance channels.

The same applies to information which directly or indirectly relates to individual investors in collective investment schemes. Article 42*a* applies. 

[3ter] FINMA may, for the purposes detailed in paragraph 3, allow the foreign financial market supervisory authority which is responsible for the consolidated supervision of the audited supervised party to consult a limited number of individual client dossiers. The dossiers must be selected randomly on the basis of predefined criteria.
