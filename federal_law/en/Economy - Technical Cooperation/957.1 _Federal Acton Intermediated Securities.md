It shall bear the conversion cost.

The account holder shall bear the cost of this conversion unless the terms of issue or the issuer’s articles of association provide otherwise.

[3] The custodian shall ensure that the conversion of the securities does not alter the total number of the personal and corporate rights issued.

[**Art.** **8** Extinction and delivery in general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/450/en#art_8)

|    b. the account holder is entitled to delivery of certificated securities under Article 7 paragraph 2.

[2] The account holder shall be entitled to the delivery of certificated securities in accordance with the custom and usage of the market on which the securities are traded.

[**Art.** **10** Effects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/450/en#art_10) 

[1] A custodian credits to the securities account of its account holder the intermediated securities credited to its own securities account with a sub-custodian.

[2] If the custody of securities with a sub-custodian is not governed by this Act, the credit confers upon the account holder rights that are at least equal to the rights acquired by the custodian with the sub-custodian.

[**Art.** **11** Available intermediated securities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/450/en#art_11) 

[1] Each custodian shall hold with itself or with a sub-custodian intermediated securities (available securities) in a quantity and of a kind at least equal to the total of intermediated securities credited to the securities accounts of its account holders (credited securities).

[2] If the total number of available securities is less than the total number of credited securities, the custodian shall without delay acquire intermediated securities to the extent of the shortfall.

[3] The following are deemed to be available securities:


|    a. intermediated securities credited to a securities account held by the custodian with a sub-custodian;  
|    b. certificated securities, ledger-based securities or global certificates that the custodian holds directly, or uncertificated securities entered in its main register; and

[1] If a custodian holds its own intermediated securities and that of its account holders in separate securities accounts with a sub-custodian, the intermediated securities of the account holders and their claims for delivery of intermediated securities shall not be affected by: 


|    a. a set-off agreement between the custodian and the sub-custodian to which the account holder is not a party;   
|    b. any right of pledge, retention, or foreclosure of the sub-custodian or of another person to which the account holder has not consented. 

[2] The custodian may dispose of an account holder’s intermediated securities only after having them transferred to its own account by exercising its right of use. 

[3] Any agreement to the contrary shall be invalid.

[2] The custodian shall not be obliged or entitled to verify the legal grounds for the instruction.

[**Art.** **19** Shortfall](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/450/en#art_19) 

[1] If the intermediated securities excluded from the custodian’s estate are not sufficient to satisfy the account holders in full, intermediated securities of the same kind held by the custodian for its own account shall also be excluded insofar as necessary, even where such intermediated securities have been held separately from the account holders’ intermediated securities. 

[2] If the account holders are still not fully satisfied, they shall bear the shortfall in proportion to the number of intermediated securities of the missing kind credited to their respective securities accounts. They shall have a corresponding claim for compensation against the custodian.

An instruction issued by a custodian which is a participant in a securities clearing or settlement system shall be legally binding and effective against third parties even in the event of debt enforcement proceedings against that custodian, provided that:


|    a. the instruction was entered into the system before the commencement of such proceedings; or  
|    b. it was entered into the system after the commencement of such proceedings and carried out on the day of commencement, if the system operator can prove that it was not aware, and should not have been aware, of the commencement of such proceedings.

[2] These intermediated securities shall be subject to the same security interest as the original security interest, and shall be treated as if they had been provided at the same time as the original security interest.

[3] To the extent provided by the security agreement with the account holder, the custodian may realise the intermediated securities in accordance with Article 31 instead of returning them.

[**Art. 23***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/450/en#art_23_a) [Passing on of information](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/450/en#art_23_a)
