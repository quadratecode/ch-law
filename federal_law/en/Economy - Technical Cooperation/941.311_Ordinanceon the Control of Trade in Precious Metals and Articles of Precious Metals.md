## [I. Purpose of the official assay](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/50/363_375_420/en#sec_5/lvl_I)

[**Art. 81**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/50/363_375_420/en#art_81) 

[1] The official control serves to ascertain whether precious metal articles and multi-metal articles have the legal standards of fineness and meet the other material requirements and whether they bear the prescribed marks and stamps.

[2] If the legal requirements have been met, this is certified by stamping the official hallmark.

## [II. The official assay](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/50/363_375_420/en#sec_5/lvl_I_I)

### [1. Mandatory](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/50/363_375_420/en#sec_5/lvl_I_I/lvl_1)

[**Art. 82**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/50/363_375_420/en#art_82) 

[1] Watch-cases made of precious metal may not be placed on the market before undergoing official controlling and hallmarking. This provision also applies to watch-cases that are destined for export and have a standard of fineness required under the legislation of the destination country.

[2] Watch-cases are deemed to be placed on the market as soon as they have left the manufacturing plant of the case manufacturer.

[3] In accordance with Article 13 paragraph 1 of the Act, the case manufacturer must apply for the official control to the Assay Office of its business area.

[4] For watch-cases in an unworked or finished condition that are to be sent directly to states that require the mandatory controlling of watch-cases, the official hallmarking may be dispensed with, subject to the provisions of Article 138. Based on the foreign statutory provisions, the Central Office shall stipulate the cases in which the aforesaid precondition applies and bring this to the attention of interested parties with appropriate presentation of guidelines with periodic updates. These guidelines shall also be forwarded to the customs offices responsible for export clearance.

### [2. Hallmarking of multi-metal articles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/50/363_375_420/en#sec_5/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

[**Art. 83**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/50/363_375_420/en#art_83)

Only those multi-metal articles bearing a fineness mark and a responsibility mark on their precious metal parts may be given the official hallmark.

## [III. Control procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/50/363_375_420/en#sec_5/lvl_II_I)

[2] If the consignment contains articles of different types, these must be arranged for testing by type and by fineness.

[3] Watch-cases must be presented open for official hallmarking.

[4] The articles must be presented in full for official hallmarking. If only parts of an article are officially hallmarked, the applicant shall sign to accept liability that the finished objects meet the statutory requirements.

[5] If possible, the articles are presented in a manufacturing stage at which the risks of damage are kept to a minimum. They must be sufficiently along the manufacturing process that no changes may be made to either the stamped hallmark or the article itself in the finishing stages.

[**Art. 86**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/50/363_375_420/en#art_86)

[4] If the determination of the fineness turns out to be correct, the person submitting the article shall be informed and receive the article against payment of the relevant fees.
