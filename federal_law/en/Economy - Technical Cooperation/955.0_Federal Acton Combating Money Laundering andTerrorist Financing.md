## [Section 1 Financial Intermediaries Duty of Due Diligence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#chap_2/sec_1)

[**Art. 3** Verification of the identity of the customer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_3) 

[1] When establishing a business relationship, the financial intermediary must verify the identity of the customer on the basis of a document of evidentiary value. Where the customer is a legal entity, the financial intermediary must acknowledge the provisions regulating the power to bind the legal entity, and verify the identity of the persons who enter into the business relationship on behalf of the legal entity.

[2] In the case of cash transactions with a customer whose identity has not yet been identified, the duty to verify identity applies only if one transaction, or two or more transactions that appear to be connected, involve a considerable financial value.

[3] Insurance institutions must verify the identity of the customer if the amount of a single premium, the regular premium or the total of the premiums involves a considerable financial value.

[4] If in cases under paragraphs 2 or 3 there is any suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, the identity of the customer must be verified even if the relevant amounts have not been reached.

[5] FINMA, the Federal Gaming Board (FGB), the Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP), the Federal Customs Administration (FCA) and the self-regulatory organisations shall determine what constitutes a considerable financial value within the meaning of paragraphs 2 and 3 in their respective fields and adjust such values as required.

[**Art. 4**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_4) [Establishing the identity of the beneficial owner](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_4) 

[1] The financial intermediary must identify the beneficial owner with the due diligence required in the circumstances. If the customer is a listed company or a subsidiary over which a listed company has majority control, the identity of the beneficial owner need not be established.

[2] The financial intermediary must obtain a written declaration from the customer as to the identity of the individual who is the beneficial owner if:


|    a. the customer is not the beneficial owner or if there is any doubt about the matter;  
|    b. the customer is a domiciliary company or an operating legal entity; or  
|    c. a cash transaction of considerable financial value in terms of Article 3 paragraph 2 is being carried out.

[3] In the case of collective accounts or collective deposits, the financial intermediary must require the customer to provide a complete list of the beneficial owners and to give notice of any change to the list immediately. 

[**Art. 5** Repetition of the verification of the identity of the customer or the establishment of the identity of the beneficial owner](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_5) 

[1] If doubt arises in the course of the business relationship as to the identity of the customer or of the beneficial owner, the verification of identity or establishment of identity in terms of Articles 3 and 4 respectively must be repeated.

[2] In the case of an insurance policy that may be surrendered, the insurance institution must also re-establish the identity of the beneficial owner if, in the event of a claim or the surrender of the policy, the person entitled to benefit is not the same person identified at the time that the insurance contract was concluded.

[**Art. 6**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_6) [Special duties of due diligence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_6) 

[1] The financial intermediary is required to ascertain the nature and purpose of the business relationship wanted by the customer. The extent of the information that must be obtained, the hierarchical level at which the decision to enter into or continue a business relationship must be taken and the regularity of checks are determined by the risk represented by the customer.

[2] The financial intermediary must clarify the economic background and the purpose of a transaction or of a business relationship if:


|    a. the transaction or the business relationship appears unusual, unless its legality is clear;  
|    b. there are indications that assets are the proceeds of a felony or an aggravated tax misdemeanour under Article 305[bis] number 1[bis] SCC or are subject to the power of disposal of a criminal or terrorist organisation (Art. 260[ter] SCC) or serve the financing of terrorism (Art. 260[quinquies] para. 1 SCC);  
|    c. the transaction or the business relationship carries a higher risk;  
|    d. the data on a customer, a beneficial owner or an authorised signatory in a business relationship or transaction are identical or very similar to the data provided to the financial intermediary by FINMA under Article 22*a* paragraph 2 letter a, by a supervisory organisation under Article 22*a* paragraph 2 letter b, by a self-regulatory organisation under Article 22*a* paragraph 2 letter c, or by the FGB under Article 22*a* paragraph 3.

[3] Business relationships with foreign politically exposed persons and their family members or close associates in terms of Article 2*a* paragraph 2 are deemed in every case to be business relationships with a higher risk.


|    [4] Business relationships with domestic politically exposed persons and politically exposed persons in international organisations and their family members or close associates in terms of Article 2*a* paragraph 2 are deemed when combined with one or more further risk criteria to be business relationships with a higher risk. 

[**Art. 7** Duty to keep records](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_7) 

[1] The financial intermediary must keep records of transactions carried out and of clarifications required under this Act in such a manner that other specially qualified persons are able to make a reliable assessment of the transactions and business relationships and of compliance with the provisions of this Act.

[2] The financial intermediary must retain the records in such a manner as to be able to respond within a reasonable time to any requests made by the prosecution authorities for information or for the seizure of assets.

[3] After the termination of the business relationship or after completion of the transaction, the financial intermediary must retain the records for a minimum of ten years.

[**Art. 7***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_7_a) [Assets of low value](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_7_a) 

The financial intermediary may dispense with complying with the duties of due diligence (Art. 3–7) if the business relationship only involves assets of low value and there is no suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing.

[**Art. 8** Organisational measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/en#art_8) 

Financial intermediaries must take the measures that are required to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing in their field of business. They must in particular ensure that their staff receive adequate training and that checks are carried out.
