The following Swiss franc denominated assets of the banks are eligible as minimum reserves:



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |    a. coins in circulation (excluding commemorative coins and bullion coins) | 100 percent |
| |    b. banknotes | 100 percent |
| |    c. sight deposits at the National Bank | 100 percent |

[**Art.****14**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_14) [Relevant liabilities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_14)

|    a. liabilities arising from money market instruments which cannot be attributed to either banks or customers, and which mature within three months;  
|    b. liabilities vis-à-vis banks payable on sight or maturing within three months;  
|    c. 20 percent of liabilities arising from customer time deposits (excluding tied pension fund monies);  
|    d. liabilities arising from customer deposits payable on sight or maturing within three months (including call money);  
|    e. liabilities arising from medium-term bank-issued notes maturing within three months;

[2] ...

[3] The terms used in paragraph 1 letters a–e refer to FINMA’s accounting regulations.

[4] Liabilities towards the National Bank are not counted in the calculation of the minimum reserves.

[**Art.****15** Level of minimum reserve and fulfilment of minimum reserve requirement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_15) 

[1] The required minimum reserve amounts to 2.5 percent of the average of the liabilities at the end of the three months preceding the reporting period.

[2] The minimum reserve requirement must be fulfilled, on an average of the respective reporting period, from the 20th of one month until the 19th of the following month.

[3] The average according to paragraph 2 will be calculated based on the relation between total daily assets available at the close of business according to Article 13, on the one hand, and the number of calendar days in the reporting period, on the other hand. For Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, the assets of the last preceding business day are to be entered.

[**Art.****16** Accountability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_16) 

By the end of the month of the terminated reporting period, the banks shall report to the National Bank whether the minimum reserve obligation has been fulfilled. The National Bank shall determine the form and manner of reporting in guidelines.

[1] If a bank fails to fulfil the minimum reserve requirement for a reporting period that has ended, it shall pay interest on the shortfall to the National Bank for the number of days of the respective reporting period. The interest rate shall exceed by four percentage points the overnight rate for Swiss franc deposits payable on average in the respective reporting period. The SARON (fixing at close of trading) serves as the basis. In the event of non-fulfilment, an amount of at least CHF 500 is payable.

[2] The National Bank shall order the bank to pay the interest amount by the end of the second month following the end of the reporting period. Should the bank disagree with the payment of interest it may, within 30 days, demand the issuance of a contestable order pursuant to the terms of Article 52 NBA.

[**Art. 28***a* Collateral](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_28_a) 

[1] To cover risk exposures, the operator shall only accept liquid collateral with low credit and market risks.

[2] The operator shall value collateral prudently. It shall apply haircuts which are also appropriate under extreme but plausible market conditions and validate them regularly.

[3] The operator shall avoid concentration risk in the collateral. In order to diversify the collateral, it shall define concentration limits and monitor compliance with these limits. The operator shall also ensure that no participants post collateral whose value will be substantially reduced in the event of their default.

[4] The operator shall ensure that it can access the collateral in a timely manner. This applies, in particular, to collateral which is:


|    a. held in custody abroad;  
|    b. issued by foreign issuers; or  
|    c. denominated in foreign currency.

[**Art. 28***b* Financial resources and default waterfall of central counterparties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_28_b) 

[1] A central counterparty shall limit its credit exposure to its participants by collecting collateral as specified in Article 28*a* in the form of initial margin, variation margin and default fund contributions.

[2] A central counterparty shall mark the participants’ collateral and positions to market, and shall collect margin (initial and variation margin) at least once daily when predefined thresholds are exceeded. In addition, it shall have the authority and capability to make intraday margin calls.

[3] The margin and the default fund contributions shall cover current and potential credit exposures under a wide range of scenarios. These scenarios shall include, but not be limited to, the default of the participant or group of participants as well as the default of the two participants or two groups of participants against which a central counterparty has the largest potential credit exposure under extreme but plausible market conditions. A group of participants consists of all participants affiliated to the same parent company.

[4] In order to cover any losses from a participant’s default, a central counterparty shall use collateral and capital in the following sequence:


|    a. margin of the defaulting participant;  
|    b. default fund contributions of the defaulting participant;  
|    c. dedicated capital of the central counterparty, which needs to be substantial relative to the central counterparty’s total capital;  
|    d. default fund contributions of the non-defaulting participants.

[**Art. 28***c* Calculating a central counterparty’s margin](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_28_c) 

[1] The initial margin of a participant shall cover the potential credit exposure arising from its default for a central counterparty due to expected price movements over an appropriate time horizon with a confidence level of at least 99%. The confidence level for over-the-counter derivatives must be at least 99.5% unless they show the same risk characteristics as exchange-traded derivatives.

[2] The appropriate time horizon pursuant to paragraph 1 corresponds to the period from the last variation margin payment up to the expected close-out or hedging of positions in the event of a participant’s default. This horizon shall be at least two business days. For over-the-counter derivatives, the horizon shall be at least five business days, unless they show the same risk characteristics as exchange-traded derivatives.

[3] A central counterparty shall base its initial margin calculation on price movements in the financial instruments underlying the positions over at least the previous 12 months. It may choose other and additional periods if these result in higher initial margin.

[4] If a central counterparty nets the positions of a participant when calculating that participant’s initial margin, then the assumptions applied with regard to the correlations in the financial instruments underlying these positions shall also be appropriate under extreme but plausible market conditions.

[5] The variation margin shall cover the current credit exposure arising from realised price movements, taking into account the predefined thresholds.

[**Art. 28***d* Risk control at central counterparties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_28_d) 

[1] A central counterparty shall assess:


|    a. by means of daily back tests, whether the initial margin meets the requirements specified in Article 28*c* paragraph 1;  
|    b. by means of daily stress tests, whether the margin and the default fund contributions meet the requirements specified in Article 28*b* paragraph 3;  
|    c. on a monthly basis, how initial margin changes when the assumptions and parameters underlying its calculation vary;  
|    d. on a monthly basis, the scenarios, models, assumptions and parameters underlying the stress tests;  
|    e. at least annually and in a comprehensive manner, its credit risk management model and the implementation thereof.

[2] In the event that a central counterparty identifies shortcomings when performing the tests specified in paragraph 1, it shall make adjustments so as to meet the requirements.

[**Art. 29** Management of liquidity risk](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_29) 

[1] The operator shall identify, measure, manage and monitor its liquidity risk through the use of appropriate procedures and tools.

[2] The operator shall have sufficient liquid resources to effect its payment obligations in all currencies when due, under a wide range of stress scenarios. As regards these liquid resources, the operator shall apply haircuts which are also appropriate under extreme but plausible market conditions.

[3] When selecting stress scenarios, the operator shall, in particular, take into account the following stress events under extreme but plausible market conditions:


|    a. the default of the participant or group of participants which would generate the largest aggregate payment obligation for the financial market infrastructure;  
|    b. additionally, for a central counterparty, the default of the two participants or two groups of participants which would generate the largest aggregate payment obligation for the central counterparty;  
|    c. the default of the largest liquidity provider in each of the five currencies in which the financial market infrastructure has the largest payment obligations.  
|    [4] Liquid resources in a currency, as specified in paragraph 2, comprise cash, credit lines and collateral in accordance with Article 50 paragraph 1 and Article 58 paragraph 1 of the Financial Market Infrastructure Ordinance of 25 November 2015 (FinMIO). 

[5] The operator shall diversify its liquidity providers and avoid concentration risk for collateral and assets in accordance with Article 50 paragraph 1 letters d and e FinMIO as well as Article 58 paragraph 1 letters d and e FinMIO.

[6] The operator shall assess:


|    a. by means of daily stress tests, whether the requirement specified in paragraph 2 is met;  
|    b. at least on a quarterly basis, the creditworthiness of the liquidity providers and their ability to meet their obligations.

[**Art. 30** Management of custody and investment risks](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_30) 

[1] The operator shall identify, measure, manage and monitor its custody and investment risks through the use of appropriate procedures and tools.

[2] If the operator places own assets or collateral and assets of participants in the custody of a third party, it shall minimise the associated risks. In particular, it shall place the collateral and assets concerned with creditworthy and, wherever possible, supervised financial institutions, and shall take measures to ensure that, if necessary, it can access the collateral and assets immediately.

[3] The operator’s investment strategy shall be consistent with its risk management strategy and allow only liquid investments with minimal credit and market risks. The operator shall avoid risk concentrations and disclose the investment strategy vis-à-vis its participants, in particular regarding the possible re-use of the collateral they have provided.

[**Art. 31** Management of general business risk](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_31) 

[1] The operator shall identify, measure, manage and monitor its general business risk through the use of appropriate procedures and tools.

[2] In order to cover losses from general business risk, the operator shall hold capital and net liquidity. Such capital and net liquidity shall be sufficient to ensure the implementation of the plan specified in Article 26, and shall in any case be sufficient to cover current operating expenses for at least six months.

[3] Collateral and other dedicated financial resources which are used to cover losses from participant defaults or from other credit or liquidity risks in accordance with Articles 28 and 29 must not be used to satisfy the requirement specified in paragraph 2.

[4] The operator shall have a plan to raise additional capital in case the requirement specified in paragraph 2 is no longer fulfilled.

[**Art. 32** Management of operational risk](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_32) 

The operator shall identify, measure, manage and monitor its operational risk through the use of appropriate procedures and tools, particularly in order to ensure information security and business continuity, taking into account recognised standards.

[**Art. 32***a* Information security](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_32_a) 

[1] The operator shall apply a company-wide approach and maintain an appropriate organisational structure with regard to planning, implementing, monitoring and improving the management of tasks and activities relating to information security (information security management).

[2] The operator shall set appropriate targets with regard to the availability, integrity, confidentiality, auditability, authenticity, accountability and non-repudiation of information, particularly data in connection with transactions that are cleared or settled via the financial market infrastructure (information security objectives).

[3] The operator shall take organisational and technical measures to ensure that the information security objectives are met during normal operations, during development and maintenance activities, and in times of increased transaction volumes. In particular, it shall take precautions enabling it to:


|    a. identify, analyse and evaluate internal and external threats to information security and, if necessary, implement appropriate protective measures;  
|    b. ensure the physical security of the data processing facilities;  
|    c. ensure the secure and continuous operation of the data processing facilities;

[**Art. 32***b* Business continuity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_32_b) 

[1] The operator shall apply a company-wide approach to maintaining or recovering business processes, in particular those business processes which are systemically important, in a timely manner in the event of damage or disruption.

[2] The operator shall define the necessary resources (premises, staff, technical facilities, data, external service providers) for the individual business areas and assess the impact of any complete or partial loss or disruption of each of these resources with regard to business processes, in particular systemically important business processes (business impact analysis). The assessment shall include any interdependency among business areas and any dependency on external service providers.

[3] Based on the business impact analysis, the operator shall define the maximum acceptable time before business processes are recovered, as well as the required degree of recovery (recovery objectives) and the associated resource requirements. The maximum acceptable time for recovery in the case of systemically important business processes, even in the event of major damage or disruption (e.g. non-availability of a business-critical building including staff), shall be two hours.

[4] The operator shall define the procedure by which it aims to meet the recovery objectives specified in paragraph 3 (business continuity strategy), and shall draw up plans that describe in detail the action to be taken and the persons responsible (business continuity plans).

[5] Subsequent to any major modifications but at least once a year, the operator shall review and test the business continuity plans with regard to their implementation and effectiveness, and to ensure that they are up to date. Such tests shall, if necessary, also involve participants and important service providers.

[3] The data centres and precautions taken to ensure their operation shall be appropriate for the fulfilment of the information security and recovery objectives specified in Articles 32*a* and 32*b*. If one of the data centres becomes inoperable, the operator shall ensure that, in particular, systemically important business processes can be continued within two hours at another data centre without the loss of any processing steps confirmed to participants.

[**Art. 32***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_32_d) [Outsourcing](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/233/en#art_32_d)

[1] The operator shall identify, measure, manage and monitor risks arising from links to other financial market infrastructures.

[2] If a central securities depository establishes a link with another central securities depository:


|    a. the central securities depository shall use appropriate collateralisation measures to cover, with a high confidence level, the credit risk arising out of the granting of credit to the other central securities depository;  
|    b. the central securities depository shall permit the re-use of securities provisionally received from the other central securities depository only after the original transfer is unconditional and irrevocable;  
|    c. the central securities depository shall, in the case of indirect links, identify, measure, manage and monitor the risks arising due to intermediary financial institutions.
