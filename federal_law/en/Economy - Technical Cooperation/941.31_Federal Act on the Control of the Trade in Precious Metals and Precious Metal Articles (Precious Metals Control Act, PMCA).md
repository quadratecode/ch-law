|    material containing precious metal which is usable for reclaiming precious metal. 

4 Precious metal articles are articles wholly comprised of precious metals with a legal standard of fineness, or articles made of precious metals with a legal standard of fineness in combination with a non metallic material. This does not include coins made of precious metals.

5 Multi-metal articles are articles made of a combination of precious metal with a legal standard of fineness and base metals.

3 Imitations are:


|    articles made of precious metals that are below the minimum legal standard of fineness or do not satisfy the other material conditions for precious metal articles;   
|    articles that qualify as multi-metal articles or plated articles but which are not marked as such or do not satisfy the material conditions for these categories of articles.

2 Depending on the outcome of the second opinion, the Central Office shall either authorise the official hallmarking or it shall have the articles seized and shall file a criminal complaint.

3 If the objection is justified but no offence appears to have been committed, the Central Office shall take the steps necessary for the further processing of the articles in question, which may not be placed on the market in Switzerland.

1 Precious metal articles, multi-metal articles, plated articles and imitations intended for export must bear the prescribed marks; in addition, watch-cases made of precious metal must also bear the prescribed official hallmark.

2 However, domestic manufacturers may, of their own accord, provide such articles with marks that are customary or prescribed in the destination country.

3 The Federal Council shall determine the requirements to be observed and the symbols used that the Assay Offices are permitted to use to confirm a standard of fineness as prescribed by the destination country. The Federal Council may define relaxed provisions for watch-cases that are verifiably exported directly to countries which stipulate mandatory controlling of watch-cases.
