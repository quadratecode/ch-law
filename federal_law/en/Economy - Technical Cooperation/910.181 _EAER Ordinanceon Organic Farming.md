[2] For the renovation of the apiaries 10 per cent per year of the queen bees and swarms not complying with this Ordinance can be incorporated into the organic-production unit provided that the queen bees and swarms are placed in hives with combs or comb foundations coming from organic-production units. In this case, the conversion period does not apply.

[2bis] For performance testing under Article 4 of the Ordinance of 14 November 2007 on Animal Husbandry bees which do not originate from organic holdings may be kept on an organic holding provided they are placed in hives with combs or comb foundations coming from organic production units. In this case, the conversion period does not apply.

[3] In case of high mortality of animals caused by health or catastrophic circumstances, with the prior written agreement of the certification body, an apiary may be reconstituted by the acquisition of conventional colonies, when colonies which comply with the provisions of this Ordinance are not available; in this case the conversion period of one year applies.

[**Art. 9** Siting of the apiaries](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2519_2519_2519/en#art_9) 

The siting of the apiaries must:


|    a.  be such that, within a radius of 3 km from the apiary site, nectar and pollen sources consist essentially of organically produced crops and/or spontaneous vegetation according to Chapter 2 of the Organic Farming Ordinance, and crops not subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, but treated with agricultural production methods complying with the ecological requirements of the Confederation and which cannot significantly affect the qualification of beekeeping production as being organic;  
|    b.  maintain enough distance from any non-agricultural production sources possibly leading to contamination, for example urban centres, motorways, industrial areas, waste dumps, waste incinerators etc. The certification body shall establish measures to ensure this requirement. The requirements of this letter do not apply to areas where flowering is not taking place or when the hives are dormant;  
|    c.  ensure enough natural nectar, honeydew and pollen sources for bees and access to water.

[1] The operator must provide the certification body with a map on an appropriate scale on which are entered the location of hives with details of the site (field, plot of land), swarming time, number in colony, storage for products, and if necessary the locations where certain processing and/or packaging processes take place. Where the Department does not identify any areas or regions under Article 16*h* paragraph 3 of the Organic Farming Ordinance, the operator must provide the certification body with appropriate documentation and evidence, including suitable analyses if necessary, that the areas accessible to his colonies meet the conditions required in this Ordinance.

[2] The certification body must be informed of the relocation of hives (e.g. register of movements) within an agreed period.

[**Art. 11** Colony register](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2519_2519_2519/en#art_11) 

The operator must keep a colony register for each colony. In it the following must be recorded:


|    a.  location of the hives;  
|    b.  information for identification of the colonies (in accordance with the O of 27 June 1995 on Livestock Epidemics – stock control of the colonies);  
|    c.  information on artificial feeding;  
|    d.  removal of honey combs and measures for honey extraction.

[**Art. 12** Feed](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2519_2519_2519/en#art_12) 

[1] At the end of the production season hives must be left with sufficiently abundant reserves of honey and pollen in the brood combs to survive the winter.

[2] Artificial feeding of colonies is authorised if reserves stored by the colony are insufficient. Organically-produced honey, preferably from the same organic beekeeping unit, shall be used for artificial feeding.

[3] With the agreement of the certification body, organically-produced sugar syrup or organically-produced feeding paste can be used instead of organically-produced honey in artificial feeding, in particular when it is required by climatic conditions that provoke crystallisation of honey (e.g. due to formation of melicitose honey).

[4] Artificial feeding may be carried out only between the last honey harvest and 15 days before the start of the next nectar or honeydew flow period.

[5] The following information shall be entered in the register of the apiaries with regard to artificial feeding: type of product, dates, quantities and hives where it is used.

[**Art. 13** Disease prevention](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2519_2519_2519/en#art_13) 

[1] Disease prevention in beekeeping shall be based on the following principles:


|    a.  Appropriate hardy breeds must be selected;  
|    b.  Suitable practices encouraging strong resistance to disease and the prevention of infections must be applied, e.g. regular renewal of colonies, systematic inspection of hives to detect any health anomalies, control of male broods, disinfecting of materials and equipment at regular intervals using agents permitted for organic beekeeping under Annex 8, safe disposal of contaminated material or sources, regular renewal of beeswax and sufficient reserves of pollen and honey in hives.

[2] The use of allopathic chemically synthesised medicinal products for preventive treatments is prohibited.

[**Art. 14** Veterinary treatment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2519_2519_2519/en#art_14) 

[1] Colonies which have become sick or infested shall be treated immediately in accordance with the Ordinance on Livestock Epidemics of 27 June 1995; if necessary they shall be placed in isolation apiaries.

[2] Only veterinary medicinal products which are authorised by the «Interkantonale Kontrollstelle für Heilmittel» (IKS) (Intercantonal Control Agency for Medicines) shall be used. By way of derogation, formic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid, and the substances menthol, thymol, eucalyptol and camphor may be used to control *Varroa jacobsoni*.

[3] Only phytotherapeutic and homeopathic products shall be used to control disease and infestation, unless the use of these products should prove or is unlikely to be effective to eradicate a disease or infestation which risks destroying colonies. Treatments using allopathic chemically synthesised medicinal products shall be used only if they are indispensable and are prescribed by a veterinarian.

[4] If a treatment is applied with allopathic chemically synthesised medicinal products, during such a period, the colonies treated must be placed in isolation apiaries and all the wax must be replaced with wax complying with the conditions in accordance with this Ordinance. Subsequently, the conversion period of one year will apply to those colonies. This provision shall not apply in the case of treatment with formic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid, and with the substances menthol, thymol, eucalyptol and camphor to control *Varroa jacobsoni*.

[5] Whenever veterinary medicinal products are to be used, the type of product (including the indication of the active pharmacological substance) together with details of the diagnosis, the posology (dosage), the method of administration, the duration of the treatment and the legal withdrawal period must be recorded clearly and declared to the certification body, which must authorise the labelling of the relevant products as organic products.

[6] In addition the guidelines for control of bee diseases laid down by the Swiss Centre for Bee Research of the Dairy Research Station must be followed.

[7] This applies without prejudice to veterinary treatments or treatments to hives, combs etc. which are prescribed by law.

[**Art. 15** Beekeeping practices](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2519_2519_2519/en#art_15) 

[1] The destruction of bees in the combs as a method of harvesting beekeeping products is prohibited.

[2] Mutilation such as clipping the wings of queen bees is prohibited except for clipping the wings of queen bees for performance testing under Article 4 of the Ordinance of 14 November 2007 on Animal Husbandry.

[3] The replacement of the queen bees involving the killing of the old queen is permitted. Preference shall be given to natural breeding and reproduction processes. Account shall be taken of the swarming instinct. The use of genetically modified bees is not permitted.

[4] The practice of destroying the drone brood is permitted only as a means of containing infestation with *Varroa jacobsoni*.

[5] The use of chemical synthetic repellents is prohibited during honey extraction operations.

[6] Particular care shall be taken to ensure adequate extraction, processing and storage of beekeeping products. All the measures to comply with this requirement shall be recorded.

[7] The removal of the supers and the honey extraction operations must be entered in the register of the apiary.

[**Art. 16** Characteristics of hives and materials used in beekeeping](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2519_2519_2519/en#art_16) 

[1] The hives must be made basically of natural materials presenting no risk of contamination to the environment or the beekeeping products.

[2] With the exception of products to control disease and infestation, only natural substances such as propolis, wax and plant oils may be used in the hives.

[3] Beeswax for new frames must come from organic production units. In agreement with the certification body, in particular in the case of new installations or during the conversion period, beeswax not coming from organic production units may be used where organically-produced beeswax is not available.

[4] The use of combs which contain broods is prohibited for honey extraction.

[5] For the purposes of protecting materials (frames, hives, combs), in particular from pests, only products listed in Annex 1 are permitted.

[6] Physical treatments such as steam or direct flame are permitted.

[7] Only the appropriate substances listed in Annex 8 are permitted for cleaning and disinfecting materials, buildings, equipment, utensils or products used in beekeeping.

|    2. The stocking density in housing shall be no more than 5 birds per m2 of permanently accessible area for laying hens and no more than 20 kg live weight per m2 for fattening poultry in fixed housing. For turkeys, the maximum stocking density between the 1st and 6th week of life shall be 30 kg and thereafter 36.5 kg live weight per m2.  
|    3. The grazing area shall be 5 m2 for each laying hen, 10 m2 for each turkey including an area of shade at least 1/3 m2 and for each broiler 2 m2, if necessary divided into several pens.  
|    4. An individual nest shall be available for every 5 laying hens, or 100 cm2 nesting area per bird for group nesters.  
|    5. ...  
|    6. A stock inspection shall be carried out for more than 50 birds.  
|    7. In the case of laying hens natural light may be supplemented by artificial means (no low frequency lighting) to provide a maximum of 16 hours light per day with a continuous nocturnal rest period without artificial light of at least eight hours.  
|    8. In housing and free range areas, turkeys must be able to carry out activities such as «plucking».  
|    9. Water fowl must have access to a stream, pond or lake whenever the weather conditions permit.  
|    10. Poultry must have access to outdoor runs for at least one third of their life as far as weather conditions permit.

### [2 Animal feeding](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2519_2519_2519/en#annex_5/lvl_d4e80/lvl_2)


|    1. The daily ration for pigs shall contain roughage, fresh or dried fodder, or silage.  
|    2. During the suckling period, piglets shall be given daily rooting earth or other comparable products.  
|    3. The percentage of fodder ingredients not produced organically may be up to 35 per cent of the total feed ration of pigs, measured as dry substance, provided dairy waste is used.  
|    4. The products listed in Annex 7 Section B 1a and k may be used as additives in silage production.  
|    5. In order to meet the nutritional requirements of livestock, the products listed in Annex 7 Section A 1 (animal feed materials of mineral origin), section B 3a (vitamins and provitamins) and section B 3b (trace elements) may be added.  
|    6. The products listed in Annex 7 Section B 1b (antioxidant agents), Section B 1g i (binders and anti-caking agents), Section B 2b (flavourings), and in Category 4 (zootechnical additives) may be used for animal feeding for the purposes listed with reference to the aforesaid categories.
