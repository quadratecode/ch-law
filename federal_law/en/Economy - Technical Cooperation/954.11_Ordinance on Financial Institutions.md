[1]The following apply to calculation of the thresholds for collective investment schemes managed by the manager of collective assets in accordance with Article 24 paragraph 2 letter a FinIA:

|    1. a single management;  
|    2. a relationship of common control; or  
|    3. a significant direct or indirect participation.


|    b. The value of the assets is calculated on at least a quarterly basis, under due consideration of any leverage effect.  
|    c. For collective investment schemes that were established more than 12 months previously, the threshold may be calculated on the basis of the average value of the assets over the last four quarters.  
|    d. The value of the collective investment schemes pursuant to Article 24 paragraph 2 letter a item 2 FinIA is calculated on the basis of the capital commitments or the nominal value of the collective investment schemes concerned, provided the price of the investments underlying such schemes is not obtained through trading on a regulated market.
