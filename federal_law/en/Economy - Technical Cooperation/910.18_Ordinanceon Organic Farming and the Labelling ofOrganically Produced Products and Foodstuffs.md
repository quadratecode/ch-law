# [Chapter 2 Requirements for Organic Production](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#chap_2)

## [Section 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#chap_2/sec_1)

[**Art. 6** Principle of total organic production](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_6) 

Organic farming methods must be used throughout the entire organic holding.

[**Art. 7**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_7) [Exceptions to the principle of total organic production](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_7) 

1 Areas where permanent crops are not grown organically is permitted on an organic holding provided that proof of ecological performance in accordance with Articles 11–25 of the Direct Payments Ordinance of 23 October 2013 (DPO) is provided for these areas.

2 Areas where permanent crops are grown organically is permitted on a non-organic holding provided that proof of ecological performance in accordance with Articles 11–25 of the DPO is provided for the part of the holding which is not farmed organically. 

3 Areas where permanent crops are grown in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 must remain the same for a minimum of five years. 

4 Production of a permanent crop described in letters a–i of Article 22 paragraph 1 of the Agriculture Terminology Ordinance of 7 December 1998 on a holding must be either totally organic or totally non-organic.

[5] The certification body may on application recognise a production facility in a non-organic agricultural holding as an independent organic holding if the production facility:


|    a. is recognisable spatially as a unit of land, buildings and facilities and is separate from other production facilities;  
|    b. has its own operations centre;  
|    c. is farmed organically throughout the year and employs one or more persons;  
|    d. has its own operating income;  
|    e. has a flow of goods that is independent and separate in space and time from the rest of the holding at all levels of production, preparation, processing, storage and marketing; and  
|    f. ensures that there is no crossover between the flow of goods from its part of operations and that from the non-organic part.

[6] Before granting recognition, the certification body shall obtain a written opinion on paragraph 5 letters a–d from the canton where the holding is located.

[7] Operators under Article 5 paragraph 2 may produce non-organically in parallel to organic production provided the two production areas have a separate flow of goods.

8 The EAER may authorise exceptions to the principle of total organic production in individual cases for research purposes.

## [Section 2 Conversion](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#chap_2/sec_2)

[**Art. 8** Normal conversion](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_8) 

1 Holdings which have changed over to organic production are considered to be conversion holdings for two years. A conversion period of two years applies to agricultural acreage, including that which is added to the organic holding. 1 January applies as the conversion date.

1bis The certification body may authorise a shorter conversion period for mushroom growing and the production of endives and sprouts.

2 The provisions of this Ordinance shall be complied with during conversion.

3 At the start of conversion, the producer and certification body shall together lay down all the measures which must be taken to ensure that the provisions of this Ordinance can be permanently complied with and verified.

[**Art. 9** Conversion in stages](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_9) 

1 If immediate total conversion involves unacceptably high risks, an organic holding growing vines, fruit, vegetables or ornamental plants may convert to organic production in stages. The entire holding must be fully converted within five years, with the exception of holdings referred to in Article 7 paragraph 1.

2 The certification body shall decide whether to authorise conversion in stages.

3 In particular, the following conditions must be met:


|    a binding conversion plan is drawn up with a detailed description of the conversion stages and a timetable;   
|    any contamination of organic parcels with unauthorised agrochemicals is avoided;   
|    areas farmed in different ways are clearly marked out;   
|    d. products produced under different methods are harvested and stored separately;  
|    e. proof of ecological performance in accordance with Articles 11–25 of the DPO is provided for areas not farmed organically;  
|    f. a sample is taken each year for analysis of the residues in organically produced products;  
|    g. the requirements laid down in the Annex are met.

4 If immediate total conversion of livestock production is not reasonable, the certification body may allow the holding to convert livestock farming in stages according to animal categories within three years.

5 Parallel production of the following is not permitted:


|    varieties which are not clearly distinguishable;   
|    animals of the same category of production animal. 

## [Section 3 Plant Production](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#chap_2/sec_3)

[**Art. 10** Fertility and biological activity of the soil](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_10) 

1 The fertility and biological activity of the soil shall be maintained and, if possible, increased. To this end, the following measures in particular shall be taken:


|    the soil shall be cultivated in such a way that it maintains sustainable productivity due to its physical, chemical and biological properties;   
|    biological diversity shall be encouraged;   
|    crop rotation, crop shares, use of grazing land and soil cultivation shall be planned in such a way that crop rotation problems, soil erosion, runoff and leaching of nutrients and plant protection products are avoided;   
|    in land cultivation, soil cover shall be sufficient to ensure that soil erosion, and losses of nutrients and plant protection products are kept to the minimum;   
|    the intensity of the production of fodder crops shall be varied and adapted to the location. 

2 Hydroculture is not permitted.

[**Art. 11** Plant protection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_11) 

1 Pests, diseases and weeds must be controlled by a combination of different measures, in particular the following:


|    a choice of appropriate species and varieties;   
|    appropriate crop rotation;   
|    mechanical cultivation procedures;   
|    thermal procedures where steaming of the soil is restricted to market gardening under cover and production of seedlings;   
|    promotion and protection of natural enemies of pests through provisions favourable to them (e.g. hedges, nesting sites, release of predators). 

2 The Department shall specify authorised plant protection products and instructions for their use. Substances which are not of plant, animal, microbial or mineral origin and are not identical to their natural form shall only be authorised if their conditions of use preclude any contact with the edible parts of the plant. This applies without prejudice to the authorisation procedure laid down in the Plant Protection Products Ordinance of 18 May 2005.

3 Plant protection products may only be used in the case of immediate danger threatening the crops.

4 The use of growth regulators, wilting products and herbicides is not permitted.

[**Art. 11***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_11_a) [Spray test](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_11_a) 

The requirements on the spray test and the rinse water tank for power take-off or self-propelled equipment used for plant protection have to be accomplished according to Annex 1 figure 6.1 DPO. Demeter holdings which only use their equipment to apply biodynamic preparations are exempt.

[**Art. 12** Fertilisation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_12) 

1 Where possible, organic fertilisers such as farmyard manure and compost must come from the holding itself.

2 The EAER shall specify the fertilisers that are authorised and the instructions for their use. Mineral nitrogen fertilisers may not be used. 

3 Fertiliser requirements have to be proved on the basis of a nutrient balance according to Article 13 DPO and the requirements according to Annex 1 number 2 DPO.

4 The quantity of nutrients applied per hectare (own farmyard manure and manure from other farms, bought fertilizers) may, under the most favourable valley conditions, correspond to no more than 2.5 livestock manure units (LMU). It shall be graded according to soil load capacity, altitude and topographical conditions. If maximum values laid down by the Canton under water pollution control legislation are lower, these apply.

5 Suitable products based on microorganisms or plants such as biodynamic preparations, and mineral powders may be used to activate compost or soil.

6 Farmyard manure may only be supplied by and to holdings which provide the ecological services laid down in the DPO.

[**Art. 13** Seeds, plants and plant propagating material](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_13) 

1 Seeds, plants and plant propagating material must come from organic holdings.

2 In the case of seeds, the mother plants, and in the case of plant propagating material, the parent plants must have been cultivated in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter for at least a generation or for the duration of two plant cycles in the case of perennial crops.

3 In derogation from paragraph 1, plant material which has been propagated in-vitro and certified in accordance with the Seeds Ordinance of 7 December 1998 may be used.

3bis The EAER shall establish a list of species or sub-species of which there are sufficient quantities of organically produced seeds and plant propagating material and a sufficient number of organically produced varieties in Switzerland.

4 This applies without prejudice to the requirements of the Seeds Ordinance.

[**Art. 13***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_13_a) [Use of non-organic seeds and plant propagating material](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_13_a) 

1 Any person who wishes to use non-organic seeds or plant propagating material must provide evidence that:


|    no suitable organically produced seeds or plant propagating material are available which fulfil their requirements; or   
|    no supplier is able to deliver the seeds or propagating material before sowing or planting, although they were ordered by the user in good time. 

2 A printout of available material taken from the information system described in Article 33*a* shall be deemed valid evidence under paragraph 1.

3 Any person who uses non-organic seeds or plant propagating material must notify the operator of the information system described in Article 33*a* of the quantity of seed or plant propagating material used and the variety.

4 In the case of species or sub-species for which there is no supply or only a very small supply of organically produced seeds or plant propagating material, non-organic seeds or plant propagating material may be used without the evidence required under paragraph 2 and without the notification required under paragraph 3. The operator of the information system shall indicate the relevant varieties and species in the information system in accordance with FOAG instructions.

5 In the case of species and sub-species referred to in Article 13 paragraph 3bis, non-organic seeds and plant propagating material may only be used if FOAG authorises the use of non-organic seeds and plant propagating material. Authorisation shall only be issued if the seeds or plant propagating material are to be used for research purposes, for tests carried out as part of small-scale field trials or to preserve varieties.

6 Non-organic seeds and non-organic seed potatoes may only be used if they have not been treated with plant protection products; this does not apply to treatment with plant protection products which are authorised for organic farming and chemical treatments which for reasons of plant health have been prescribed for all varieties of a particular species in the production area.

[**Art. 14** Collection of wild plants](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_14) 

1 Collection of edible wild plants and plant parts which grow naturally in forests and on agricultural land are deemed to be production within the context of organic farming if:


|    this land has not been treated with unauthorised products for three years preceding collection; and   
|    collection does not prejudice the stability of the natural environment and the conservation of species in the collection area. 

2 The collection area must be geographically defined.

3 The collection process must be thoroughly documented.

4 The inspection procedure for organic holdings shall be applied as appropriate.

## [Section 4 Livestock Production](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#chap_2/sec_4)

[**Art. 15**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_15) [Requirements for livestock farming](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_15) 

[1] Bovine species, including bubalus and bison species, equine species, sheep, goats, porcine species and poultry shall be kept in accordance with the provisions on regular outdoor exercise of Article 75 DPO and the requirements according to Annex 6 DPO. The provisions on particularly animal friendly housing systems of Article 74 DPO and the requirements of Annex 6 DPO apply to the keeping of rabbits. 

[2] The EAER may issue additional regulations for:


|    livestock housing;   
|    stock-keeping and breeding;   
|    grazing and outdoor runs. 

[3] Rules for stockfarming may also be issued for the other categories of livestock. 

[**Art. 15***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_15_a) [Tethering](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_15_a) 

[1] It is not permitted to keep animals tethered.

[2] In agreement with the certification body, however, the following may be kept tethered:


|    individual animals for a limited period for reasons of safety or animal welfare;   
|    b. animals of the bovine species, provided the provisions on regular outdoor exercise laid down in Article 75 DPO are complied with.

3 ... 

[**Art. 15***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_15_b) [Summer pasture](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_15_b) 

If animals are put to summer pasture, the summer pasture must be on organic holdings. In special cases, the summer pasture may be on holdings which comply with the requirements of Articles 26–34 DPO. 

[**Art. 16**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16) [Principles of livestock feeding](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16) 

[1]The fodder must meet the physiological nutritional requirements of the livestock at various stages of their development and must be intended to ensure quality production rather than maximising production.

[2]Force-feeding and keeping of livestock under conditions which could lead to anaemia is not permitted.

[**Art. 16***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16_a) [Feedingstuffs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16_a) 

[1]The Department shall lay down which feedingstuffs are permitted and how feedingstuffs are used.

[2]It may prohibit the use of certain feed additives and technical aids, and certain processing methods.

[3]In derogation from the principle laid down in Article 3 letter c, it may authorise feed additives and technical aids which have been produced using genetically modified organisms if:


|    a. they cannot be replaced by other substances; and  
|    b. they are not available on the market manufactured in any other way.

[4]The purchase of feedingstuffs to supplement the holding’s own feed stocks is permitted. Purchases must be from organically produced crops and if possible from the same region. For the purposes of harmonisation with the relevant EU legislation, the Department may make provision that a limited percentage of non-organic animal feedingstuffs may be purchased.

[5]The addition of feedingstuffs from conversion holdings is permitted on average up to a maximum of 30 per cent of the ration of individual categories of production animal, as dry matter. If this feedingstuff is from the holding itself, the amount may be 60 per cent, and, where this is a conversion holding, 100 per cent.

[6] In case of proven fodder yield losses, especially due to exceptional weather conditions, the directly affected livestock farmer may use non-organic fodder for a limited period with the prior written agreement of the certification body, provided that the livestock farmer is able to satisfy the certification body that insufficient organic fodder is available. If whole areas are affected by fodder yield losses, FOAG may also grant permission for the area.

[7] Fodder ingredients must be left natural and fodder preparation methods used must be as natural and energy-saving as possible. Feedingstuffs may not contain any traces of genetically modified organisms or of secondary products of genetically modified organisms which proportionally are higher than the maximum levels for unavoidable impurities laid down in legislation on feedingstuffs.

8 Animals in nomadic herds and animals put out to summer pasture may temporarily graze on non-organically farmed areas. The amount of fodder consumed, as dry matter, may not exceed 10 per cent of the total annual fodder intake.

9 The proportion of non-organically grown fodder may amount to 10 per cent of the total fodder consumption for retired horses.

[**Art. 16***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16_b) [Specific rules for nutrition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16_b) 

[1] Ruminants must receive at least 60 per cent of fodder dry matter in the form of roughage, fresh or dried fodder or silage.

[2] The feeding of young mammals must be based on natural milk, preferably maternal milk. All mammals must be fed for a minimum period on natural milk. The minimum period depends on the animal species. It shall be three months for bovines (including bubalus and bison species) and equines, 35 days for sheep and goats and 40 days for pigs.

3 For poultry, the feed formula used in the fattening stage must consist of 65 percent grain and grain legumes (their products and by-products) as well as oil seeds (their products and by-products).

[**Art. 16***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16_c) [Reproduction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16_c) 

1 The health and productivity (life output) of livestock and the quality of livestock products must be promoted by the selection of suitable breeds and breeding methods.

2 Reproduction of livestock must be based on natural methods.

3 Artificial insemination is permitted. Other forms of artificial or otherwise influenced reproduction (e.g. embryo transfer) are not permitted. They may be used with the prior written agreement of the certification body if this is necessary to preserve endangered genetic resources. Affected animals and their products may not be marketed with any reference to organic farming.

4 No livestock produced from embryo transfer shall be brought in, with the exception of animals of the bovine species in a rearing contract with a non-organic holding. In this case, the animals must return to the original holding after a period laid down in the contract. Animals from embryo transfer which were already kept on the holding before conversion of the holding may still be kept until their departure according to the provisions of this Ordinance.

[**Art. 16***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16_d) [Animal health](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1997/2498_2498_2498/en#art_16_d) 

1 Disease prevention must be based on the following principles:


|    a. selection of suitable breeds or strains;  
|    b. application of animal husbandry practices appropriate to the requirements of each species, encouraging strong resistance to disease and the prevention of infections;  
|    c. the use of high-quality feed, together with regular exercise (pasture, outdoor run, outdoor climate area) to encourage the natural immunological defence of livestock;  
|    d. ensuring an appropriate density of livestock, thus avoiding overstocking and any resulting animal health problems.

2 If an animal becomes sick or injured, it must be treated immediately, if necessary in isolation, and in suitable housing.

3 The use of veterinary medicinal products in organic stockfarming shall comply with the following principles:


|    a. Phytotherapeutic products (e.g. plant extracts, excluding antibiotics, or plant essences), homeopathic products (e.g. plant, animal and mineral substances) and trace elements and products laid down by the Department for this purpose shall be used in preference to chemically-synthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics, provided that their therapeutic effect is shown to be effective for the species of animal and the condition for which the treatment is intended.   
|    b. If the use of the products listed in letter a should not prove to be effective in combating illness or injury, but treatment is essential to prevent suffering or distress to the animal, chemically-synthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics may be used under the responsibility of a veterinarian.  
|    c. The use of coccidiostatics and the use of hormones or similar substances to control reproduction (e.g. induction or synchronisation of oestrus), or for other purposes, is not permitted. Nevertheless, hormones may be administered to an individual animal as a form of therapeutic veterinary treatment.  
|    d. The use of chemically-synthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics for preventive treatments is not permitted.

4 The type of product (including an indication of the active pharmacological substances involved) together with details of the diagnosis, the method of administration, the duration of the treatment and the prescribed withdrawal period must be recorded clearly and indelibly in writing in the treatment book.

5 Livestock treated must be clearly identified as such at all times – individually in the case of large animals, individually or as a group, in the case of poultry or small animals.

6 Vaccination and worming is permitted where there is an existing animal health risk.

7 ...

8 The withdrawal period between the last administration of a chemically-synthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal product under normal conditions of use, and the production of organically produced foodstuffs from such animals must be twice the legal withdrawal period. This does not apply to the use of products to dry up cows with udder problems.

[9] With the exception of vaccinations, treatments for parasites, anaesthetic agents, pain relief treatments and treatments as part of state livestock epidemic programmes, where an animal or group of animals receives more than three courses of treatments with chemically-synthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics within one year (or more than one course of treatment if their production lifecycle is less than one year), the livestock concerned, or produce derived from them, shall not be sold as being produced in accordance with this Ordinance, and the livestock must undergo the conversion periods laid down in Article 16*f* paragraph 2.

1 Zootechnical procedures shall be kept to the minimum. They must be carried out by qualified personnel at the age most appropriate for the animal.

2 Procedures such as docking tails, clipping teeth and, in the case of poultry, beaks, toes and wings, castration, the dehorning of adult animals and the use of nose rings and the fitting of clips and wires in the nose ring for pigs is not permitted.

2bis In justified cases, the dehorning of adult animals for safety reasons is permitted, provided that it is conducted properly under anaesthetic by a veterinary surgeon and not during the months of May, June, July and August.

3 The following procedures may be carried out on individual animals:


|    a. attaching elastic bands to the tails of sheep, if this is necessary to improve the health, welfare or hygiene of the livestock;  
|    b. dehorning of young animals, except for yaks, water buffalo and bison, under anaesthetic, if this is necessary for reasons of safety;  
|    c. castration in order to maintain the quality of products.
