[1] Where, for whatever cause not imputable to the consumer, the organiser cancels the package before the agreed date of departure, the consumer is entitled to the rights under Article 10.

[2] The consumer is not, however, entitled to claim for damages for non-performance of the contract:


|    a. if the cancellation is on the grounds that the number of persons enrolled for the package is less than the minimum number required and the consumer is informed of the cancellation, in writing, within the period indicated in the contract; or  
|    b. if the cancellation is due to force majeure. Overbooking is not considered a case of force majeure.

[1] Any limitation of liability by means of a contractual clause for personal injury arising from the non-performance or improper performance of the contract is excluded.
