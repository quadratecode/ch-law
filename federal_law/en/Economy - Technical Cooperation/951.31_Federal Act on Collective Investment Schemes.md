## [Chapter 2 Collective Investment Schemes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#tit_1/chap_2)

[**Art. 7** Definition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#art_7) 

[1] Collective investment schemes are assets raised from investors for the purpose of collective investment, and which are managed for the account of such investors. The investment requirements of the investors are met on an equal basis.

[2] Collective investment schemes may be open or closed-ended.

[3] The Federal Council may stipulate a minimum number of investors in accordance with the legal status and target group. It may authorise collective investment schemes for a single qualified investor (single investor fund) in accordance with Article 10 paragraph 3 in conjunction with Article 4 paragraph 3 letters b, e and f of the Financial Services Act of 15 June 2018 (FinSA). 

[4] In the case of single investor funds, the fund management company and the in- vestment company with variable capital (SICAV) may delegate the investment decisions to the single investor. FINMA may exempt them from the duty to subject themselves to supervision recognised under Article 31 paragraph 3 and Article 36 paragraph 3, respectively.

[5] Collective investment schemes must have their registered office and head office in Switzerland.

[**Art. 8** Open-ended collective investment schemes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#art_8) 

[1] Open-ended collective investment schemes may be in the form of a contractual fund (Art. 25 et seq.) or SICAV (Art. 36 et seq.).

[2] With open-ended collective investment schemes, investors have either a direct or indirect legal entitlement, at the expense of the collective assets, to redeem their units at the net asset value.

[3] Each open-ended collective investment scheme has its own fund regulations. In the case of contractual funds this is the collective investment contract (fund contract), and in the case of SICAVs it is the articles of association and the investment regulations.

[**Art. 9** Closed-ended collective investment schemes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#art_9) 

[1] Closed-ended collective investment schemes may be in the form of a limited partnership for collective capital investments (Art. 98 et seq.) or an investment company with fixed capital (SICAF, Art. 110 et seq.).

[2] In the case of closed-ended collective investment schemes, investors have neither a direct nor an indirect legal entitlement at the expense of the collective assets to the redemption of their units at the net asset value.

[3] Limited partnerships for collective investment are based on a company agreement.

[4] SICAFs are based on articles of association and issue a set of investment regulations.

[**Art. 10** Investors](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#art_10) 

[1] Investors are natural and legal persons, as well as general and limited partnerships, which hold units in collective investment schemes.

[2] Collective investment schemes are open to all investors, except where this Act, the fund regulations or the articles of association restrict investor eligibility to qualified investors.

[3] Qualified investors within the meaning of this Act are professional clients as defined in Article 4 paragraphs 3–5 or Article 5 paragraphs 1 and 4 FinSA:

[3bis] ...

[3ter] Qualified investors also include retail clients for whom a financial intermediary in accordance with Article 4 paragraph 3 letter a FinSA or a foreign financial intermediary that is subject to equivalent prudential supervision provides portfolio management or investment advice in accordance with Article 3 letter c items 3 and 4 FinSA within the scope of a permanent portfolio management or investment advice relationship, provided they have not declared that they do not wish to be treated as such. Such declaration must be made in writing or in another form demonstrable via text.

[4] ...

[5] The FINMA may fully or partially exempt collective investment schemes from certain provisions of the financial market acts within the meaning of Article 1 paragraph 1 of the Financial Market Supervision Act of 22 June 2007 (FINMASA), provided that they are exclusively open towards qualified investors and that the protective purpose of this Act is not impaired, specifically from the provisions concerning:


|    a. ...  
|    b. ...  
|    c. the requirement to produce a semi-annual report;  
|    d. the requirement to provide investors with the right to terminate their invest- ment at any time;  
|    e. the requirement to issue and redeem units in cash;  
|    f. risk diversification.

[**Art. 11** Units](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#art_11) 

Units are claims against the fund management company conferring entitlement to the assets and income of the investment fund or interests in the investment company.

[**Art. 12** Protection against confusion or deception](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#art_12) 

[1] The designation «collective investment scheme» must not provide any grounds for confusion or deception, in particular in relation to the investments.

[2] Designations such as «investment fund», «investment company with variable capital», «SICAV», «limited partnership for collective investment», «investment company with fixed capital» and «SICAF» may only be used for the relevant collective investment schemes governed by this Act.

### [Section 1 Definition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_1)

[**Art. 25**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#art_25) 

[1] The contractual fund (investment fund) is based on a collective investment agree- ment (fund contract) under which the fund management company commits itself to:


|    a. involving investors in accordance with the number and type of units which they have acquired in the investment fund;  
|    b. managing the fund's assets in accordance with the provisions of the fund contract at its own discretion and for its own account.

[2] The custodian bank is a party to the contract in accordance with the tasks conferred on it by the law and by the fund contract.

[3] The investment fund must have the stipulated minimum assets. The Federal Coun- cil determines the level thereof, and the period in which it must be accumulated.

### [Section 2 The Fund Contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_2)

[**Art. 26** Content](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#art_26) 

[1] The fund management company draws up the fund contract and, with the consent of the custodian bank, submits it to FINMA for approval.

[3] The Federal Council determines the minimum contents.

[**Art. 27** Amendments to the fund contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2006/822/en#art_27) 

[1] Amendments to the fund contract must be submitted by the fund management company, with the consent of the custodian bank, to FINMA.

[2] If the fund management company amends the fund contract, it must publish a summary of the significant amendments in advance, in which reference is made to the locations where the full wording of the contractual amendments may be obtained free of charge.

[3] These publications must inform investors of their right to lodge objections with FINMA within 30 days of their publication. The procedure is based on the Federal Act on Administrative Procedure of 20 December 1968. Investors must further- more be made aware that they may request the repayment of their units in cash, while observing the contractual or regulatory notice period.

[4] FINMA publishes its decision in the media of publication.
