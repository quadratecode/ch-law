### [Section 3 Derivative Financial Instruments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#tit_1/chap_1/sec_3)

(Art. 56 para. 3 CISA; Art. 72 CISO)

[**Art. 23** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_23) 

The terms below are defined as follows:


|    a. «basic type of derivative»:  
|    1. a call or put option, the expiration value of which is linearly dependent on the positive or negative difference between the market value of the underlying and the strike price and is zero if the difference is preceded by the opposite algebraic sign,   
|    2. a credit default swap (CDS),   
|    3. a swap, the payments of which are dependent on the value of the underlying or on an absolute amount in both a linear and a path-independent manner,   
|    4. a future or forward transaction the value of which is linearly dependent on the value of the underlying;


|    b. «exposure-increasing»: derivative exposure, the financial effect of which is similar to the purchase of an underlying (e.g. the purchase of a call option, purchase of a future, sale of a put option, exchanging of variable for fixed interest payments or the conclusion of a credit default swap as protection seller);  
|    c. «exposure-reducing»: a derivative exposure the financial effect of which is similar to the sale of an underlying (in particular, the sale of a call option, sale of a future, purchase of a put option, exchanging of fixed for variable interest payments or the conclusion of a credit default swap as secured party);  
|    d. «exotic derivative» means a derivative with a mode of operation that cannot be described as a basic form of derivative or a combination of basic forms of derivatives (for instance, a path-dependent option, an option with several factors or an option with contract modifications);  
|    e. «contract size»: number of underlying securities or nominal value of a derivative contract;  
|    f. «contract value»:  
|    1. in the case of a swap, the product of the nominal value of the underlying and the contract size,

|    g. «OTC (over the counter)»: the conclusion of transactions off an exchange or any other regulated market which is open to the public;  
|    h. «synthetic liquidity»: underlyings whose market risk and potential credit risk are hedged with derivatives that have a symmetric payment profile;

|    l. «leverage»: effect of derivatives, derivative components investment techniques, including short-selling on the fund’s net assets, by building up over-proportionally high positions in an underlying when compared to the capital invested.

[**Art. 24** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_24) 

Derivatives may be used only where, even in exceptional market conditions, the effect of using derivatives does not result in a deviation from the investment objectives set out in the fund regulations, prospectus and important information for investors, or in a change in the investment character of the securities fund.

[**Art. 25** Umbrella funds](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_25) 

The provisions in this section apply to the individual securities funds or, in the case of an umbrella fund, to each individual sub-fund.

[**Art. 26** Structured products, derivative components and warrants](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_26) 

[1] In order to comply with the statutory and regulatory provisions for risk diversification, the underlying and the issue of a structured product must be taken into account.

[2] If a structured product has one or more derivative components, these must be treated in accordance with the provisions in this section.

[3] To establish the amount eligible for the overall exposure and the risk diversification requirements, the structured product is to be broken down into its components, if it has leverage. The components are to be considered individually. The breakdown is to be documented.

[4] If structured products that cannot be broken down are used as a not negligible part of the fund’s assets, the model approach as a risk measurement procedure is to be applied.

[5] Derivative components of a financial instrument must be taken into account in compliance with statutory and regulatory risk diversification provisions, and are eligible for the overall exposure to derivatives. 

[6] Warrants must be treated as derivatives in accordance with the provisions of this section. An option belonging to a warrant bond is deemed a warrant.

[**Art. 27** Credit derivatives](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_27) 

[1] As defined in Article 77 paragraph 1 letter a CISO, an exposure-increasing credit derivative is not deemed a guarantee.

[2] The debtor of reference of a credit derivative must have outstanding equity or debt securities or rights to equity or debts that are traded on an exchange or another regulated market open to the public.

[**Art. 28** Exotic derivatives](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_28) 

[1] The fund management company or SICAV may only use an exotic derivative if:


|    a. it can calculate the minimum and the maximum delta across the entire price spectrum of the underlyings; and   
|    b. it understands the derivative's mode of operation, as well as the factors that influence its pricing.

[2] In the case of securities funds, where the commitment approach II is applied, the exotic derivative must be weighted according to its maximum possible delta (absolute value) when converted to its underlying equivalent pursuant to Article 35 paragraph 2. 

[3] The risk assessment model used risk must be capable of reflecting the exotic derivative in accordance with its risk.

[4] If the maximum delta of the exotic derivative is positive, it must be weighted by such maximum delta in order to comply with the statutory and regulatory maximum limits. If the minimum delta is negative, it must be weighted by this minimum delta in order to comply with the regulatory minimum limits.

[**Art. 29** Conclusion of the contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_29) 

[1] The fund management company or SICAV shall conclude derivative transactions on an exchange or other regulated market which is open to the public.

[2] Transactions with OTC derivatives (OTC transactions) are permitted, provided the conditions stipulated in Articles 30 and 31 are met.

[**Art. 30** OTC transactions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_30) 

[1] OTC transactions may only be concluded on the basis of a standardised framework agreement which complies with the pertinent international standards.

[2] The counterparty must:


|    a. be a regulated financial intermediary specialised in such types of transactions;  
|    b. ensure proper execution of the contract; and   
|    c. meet the credit rating requirements stipulated in Article 31 paragraph 1.

[3] It must be possible to reliably and verifiably value an OTC derivative on a daily basis and to sell or close out the derivative at market value at any time.

[4] If the market price for an OTC derivative is not available, it must be possible at all times to determine the price at any time using appropriate valuation models that are recognised in practice, based on the market value of the underlyings from which the derivative was derived;

[5] Before concluding a contract for a derivative under paragraph 4, specific offers must be obtained from at least two potential counterparties. The contract is to be concluded with the counterparty providing the most favourable offer in terms of price. A deviation from this principle is possible for reasons relating to risk diversification, or where other parts of the contract such as credit rating or the range of services offered by the counterparties in another offer seem are more advantageous overall for the investors.

[6] If it is in the investors’ best interests, obtaining offers from at least two potential counterparties may be dispensed with. The reasons for doing so must be clearly documented.

[7] The conclusion of the transaction and pricing must be clearly documented.

[**Art. 31** Credit rating](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_31) 

[1] In the case of OTC transactions, the counterparty or its guarantor shall have a high credit rating.

[2] This requirement does not apply to the custodian bank of the securities fund.

[**Art. 32** Valuation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_32) 

[1] Derivatives for which market prices are available shall be valued at the current prices paid on the main market. Prices are to be obtained from an external source specialising in this type of transaction and which operates independently of the fund management company or SICAV and its agents.

[2] If no current market price is available for derivatives, it must be possible to determine the price at any time using appropriate valuation models that are recognised in practice, based on the market value of the underlyings. Valuations are to be documented clearly.

[**Art. 33** Risk measurement procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_33) 

[1] The fund management company or SICAV shall apply commitment approach I or II, or the model approach.

[2] The model approach requires the approval of FINMA.

[3] The fund management company or SICAV shall align the risk assessment process selected with the investment objectives.

[4] The model approach must be used where:


|    a. the overall exposure of the securities fund using commitment approach I or II cannot be appropriately recorded and measured;  
|    b. a not negligible amount is being invested in exotic derivatives; or  
|    c. complex investment strategies of a not negligible amount are being used.

[**Art. 34** Commitment approach I](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_34) 

[1] For a securities fund applying commitment approach I, only basic derivative types are permitted. They may only be used where account is taken of the necessary coverage set out in this article and their use does not result in a leverage effect on the fund’s assets nor does it involve short-selling.

[2] Exposure-reducing derivatives must at all times be covered by the relevant underlyings. If the delta has been calculated, it may be taken into account when calculating the necessary underlyings. Article 44 paragraph 3 also applies *mutatis muta**n**dis*.

[3] Covering with other investments is permitted if the exposure-reducing derivative is indexed by an independent external office. The index must be representative of the underlyings and there must be an adequate correlation between the index and such investments.

[4] The underlying equivalents (Art. 35 para. 2) of exposure-increasing derivatives must at all times be covered by highly liquid assets.

[5] The following assets are considered highly liquid:


|    a. liquid assets as defined in Article 75 CISO;  
|    b. money market instruments as defined in Article 74 CISO;  
|    c. collective investment schemes which invest exclusively in liquid assets or money market instruments;  
|    d. debt securities and rights with a time remaining till maturity of maximum twelve months and the issuer or guarantor have a high credit rating;  
|    e. synthetic liquidity;  
|    f. credit limits accorded to, but not used by, the securities fund, in line with the statutory and regulatory maximum investment limits;  
|    g. withholding tax credits as confirmed by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.

[6] Account can be taken of permitted netting rules and hedging transactions under Article 36 paragraphs 1, 2 and 4. Covered hedging transactions by interest derivatives are permitted. Convertible bonds do not have to be taken into account when calculating the overall exposure to derivatives.

[**Art. 35** Commitment approach II: determination of the overall exposure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_35) 

[1] To establish the overall exposure of a securities fund using commitment approach II, the fund management company shall determine the individual conversion amounts of the respective derivatives and derivative components as well as the conversion amounts arising from investment techniques.

[2] In the case of basic types of derivatives, the conversion amount for the overall exposure arising from derivatives is normally the underlying equivalent, based on the market value of the underlying assets of the derivatives. The underlying equivalents are calculated in accordance with Annex 1. The nominal value or the forward price of futures contracts calculated on each trading day may be taken as the basis, if the result is a more conservative calculation.

[3] The conversion amount for the overall exposure is the basic commitment from the net fund assets and the sum of the following absolute values:


|    a. conversion amounts of the individual derivatives and derivative components pursuant to Annex 1 that are not included in netting pursuant to Article 36;  
|    b. conversion amounts after permitted netting pursuant to Article 36; and  
|    c. conversion amounts from permitted investment techniques.

[4] The following transactions may be disregarded when determining the conversion amount for the overall exposure arising from derivatives pursuant to paragraph 3:


|    a. swaps by means of which the performance of the underlyings directly held by the securities fund is swapped with the performance of other underlyings (total return swaps), provided that:  
|    1. the market risk of the swapped underlyings is completely eliminated from the securities fund so that these assets have no impact on the change in the value of the securities fund, and   
|    2. the swap does not grant option rights or contain leverage or other additional market risks that exceed those of a direct investment in the relevant underlyings;


|    b. derivatives to which corresponding highly liquid assets are assigned so that the combination of derivative and highly liquid assets is equivalent to a direct investment in the underlying asset and neither an additional market risk nor leverage is generated. The highly liquid assets used to cover the derivative position may not be used for more than one combination simultaneously.

[5] Securities lending and repurchase transactions must be taken into account when calculating the overall exposure if these generate leverage on the fund assets through the reinvestment of collateral. Where collateral is reinvested in financial assets that provide a return in excess of the risk-free interest rate, the amount received must be included when determining the overall exposure if cash collateral is held.

[**Art. 36** Commitment approach II: rules on netting and hedging transactions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_36) 

[1] Counter positions in derivatives based on the same underlying as well as counter positions in derivatives and in investments in the same underlying may be netted, irrespective of the maturity date of the derivatives, provided that:


|    a. the derivative transaction was concluded with the sole purpose of eliminating the risks associated with the derivatives or investments acquired;  
|    b. no material risks are disregarded in the process; and  
|    c. the conversion amount of the derivatives is determined pursuant to Article 35.

[2] If the derivatives in hedging transactions do not relate to the same underlying as the asset that is to be hedged, the following additional conditions must be met for netting:


|    a. The derivative transaction is not based on an investment strategy that serves to generate a profit.  
|    b. The derivative results in a demonstrable reduction in the risk of the securities fund.  
|    c. The general and special risks of the derivative are balanced out.   
|    d. The derivatives, underlyings or assets that are to be netted relate to the same class of financial instruments.  
|    e. The hedging strategy remains effective even under exceptional market conditions.

[3] Where interest rate derivatives are predominantly used, the amount to be included in the overall exposure arising from derivatives can be determined using internationally recognised duration-netting rules provided that:


|    a. the rules result in a correct determination of the risk profile of the securities fund;   
|    b. the material risks are taken into account;  
|    c. the use of these rules does not generate an unjustified level of leverage;  
|    d. no interest rate arbitrage strategies are pursued; and  
|    e. the leverage of the securities fund is not increased either by applying these rules or through investments in short-term positions.

[4] Notwithstanding paragraph 2, derivatives that are used solely for currency hedging purposes and do not result in leverage or contain additional market risks may be netted when calculating the overall exposure arising from derivatives.

[**Art. 37** Commitment approach II: documentation requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_37) 

All calculations under Articles 35 and 36 must be clearly documented.

[**Art. 38** Model approach: principles of value-at-risk (VaR)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_38) 

[1] Applying the model approach, the fund management company or SICAV shall estimate the risks for a securities fund as value-at-risk (VaR).

[2] The model must be fully documented. The documentation must in particular provide information about the specification of the risk assessment model, back-testing and stress tests.

[3] The fund management company or SICAV shall verify the suitability of the model on a periodic basis, but at least once a year. The results must be clearly documented.

[4] The VaR of a securities fund may at no time exceed twice the VaR of the benchmark portfolio of such securities fund (relative VaR limits)

[5] When using the model approach, the fund management or the SICAV must ensure a periodical calculation of the gross overall exposure to derivatives of the securities fund in question.

[**Art. 39** Model approach: calculation of VaR](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_39) 

[1] The VaR may be determined using variance/covariance models, historical simulations and Monte-Carlo simulations. When selecting the model, the investment strategy is to be taken into account.

[2] The VaR must be calculated daily on the basis of the previous day's positions using the following parameters:


|    a. a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval;  
|    b. a holding period of 20 trading days;  
|    c. an effective historical observation period of at least one year (250 bank working days).

[3] The VaR factors in interest rate risk, currency risk, share price risk and commodity risks. The following must also be taken into account:


|    a. gamma and vega risks in the case of option positions;  
|    b. specific risks in the form of residual risks;  
|    c. event, default and liquidity risks as part of stress tests.

[4] The calculations must be clearly documented.

[5] Variance from the confidence interval, the holding period or the observation period is possible owing to exceptional market circumstances, and must have the prior approval of FINMA.

[**Art. 40** Model approach: benchmark portfolio](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_40) 

[1] The benchmark portfolio of a securities fund is assets without any leverage and generally without any derivatives.

[2] The composition of the benchmark portfolio corresponds to the information in the fund regulations, prospectus and information necessary for the securities fund’s investors, specifically concerning its investment objectives, investment policy and limits.

[3] It must be reviewed periodically, but at least once a quarter. The respective composition and any changes thereto must be documented clearly.

[4] Where a benchmark, such as an equity index for benchmark portfolios, is defined in the fund regulations or in the prospectus and information necessary for the securities fund’s investors, it may be used for calculating the VaR of the benchmark portfolios. The benchmark must be:


|    a. derivative-free and not have any leverage;  
|    b. calculated by an independent, external office; and  
|    c. representative of the investment objectives, investment policy and limits of the securities fund.  
|    [5] The benchmark portfolio may include derivatives, where:   
|    a. according to the fund regulations or prospectus, the securities fund is implementing a long/short strategy, and in the benchmark portfolio the short exposure is shown as derivatives;  
|    b. according to the fund regulations or prospectus, the securities fund is implementing a currency hedge investment policy and a currency hedge benchmark portfolio is used as a benchmark.

[6] If it is not possible to construct a representative benchmark portfolio on the basis of the specific investment objectives and investment policy of a securities fund, a VaR limit may be agreed upon with FINMA (absolute VaR limit). This must be stated in the prospectus.

[**Art. 41** Model approach: reviewing the risk assessment model](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_41) 

[1] In the case of a securities fund, the forecast quality of the risk assessment model must be examined by comparing the actual changes in the value of its net assets during the course of a trading day with the relevant one-day VaR (back-testing).

[2] The comparison must be documented clearly.

[3] The sample to be used must be compiled from the previous 250 observations.

[4] If back-testing shows the risk assessment model to be impracticable, the audit company and FINMA must be notified forthwith.

[5] If back-testing produces more than six anomalies, the practicability of the risk assessment model must be examined in depth and the audit company and FINMA notified forthwith.

[6] If the model is impracticable, FINMA may demand a swift rectification of any shortcomings of the model and order tighter restrictions on the risk.

[**Art. 42** Model approach: stress tests](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_42) 

[1] In the case of securities funds, extreme market circumstances must be simulated periodically, but at least monthly (stress tests).

[2] Stress tests must also be conducted where significant changes to the results of the stress test owing to changes in the value or the composition of the securities fund’s assets, or to changes in the market circumstances cannot be excluded. 

[3] Stress tests include all risk factors which may have a material influence on the market value of the securities fund. Special attention must be paid to risk factors which are not or only insufficiently taken into account by the risk assessment model.

[4] The results of the conducted stress tests and any necessary resulting measures must be clearly documented

[**Art. 43** Model approach: changes under the model approach](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_43) 

[1] FINMA may allow variances from the requirements stipulated in Articles 39- 43.

[2] It may permit the use of other risk assessment models, provided they afford an appropriate degree of protection.

[3] If changes are made to the risk assessment model, back-testing or stress tests, these changes must be submitted to FINMA for approval in advance.

[**Art. 44** Cover for a physical delivery obligation of an underlying](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_44) 

[1] If the fund management company or SICAV enters into a physical delivery obligation in respect of a derivative, this derivative must be covered by the corresponding underlyings.

[2] Cover of such an obligation with other investments is permitted if the investments and the underlyings are highly liquid and, if delivery is requested, they may be purchased or sold at any time.

[3] The fund management company or SICAV must have unrestricted access to these underlyings or investments at all times.

[**Art. 45** Covering a payment obligation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_45) 

[1] If the fund management company or SICAV enters into a payment obligation in respect of a derivative, this payment obligation must at all times be covered by highly liquid assets as defined in Article 34 paragraph 5.

[2] In the case of securities funds applying commitment approach II or the model approach, the following shall additionally be recognised as cover:


|    a. debt securities and rights the remaining time to maturity of which is more than twelve months and whose issuer or guarantor has a high credit rating;  
|    b. shares traded on an exchange or another regulated market open to the public.

[3] It must be possible at all times to turn collateral as defined in paragraph 2 into liquid assets within seven banking days.

[4] Shares may only be included as cover at market value less a security margin. This security margin must take account of the volatility of the corresponding share and must amount to at least 15 percent.

[5] If an investment may require an additional payment, it is deemed an obligation to pay.

[**Art. 46** General provisions for inclusion of investment restrictions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_46) 

[1] In complying with the statutory and regulatory investment restrictions on determining maximum and minimum limits, the following must be taken into account:


|    a. investments, including derivatives, in accordance with Article 70 CISO;  
|    b. liquid assets as defined in Article 75 CISO;  
|    c. claims against counterparties arising from OTC transactions.

[2] Pursuant to Article 82 CISO, exceptions may be made for index funds.

[3] Any overrun of an investment limit due to a change in the delta must be rectified within three banking days; the rectification must ensure that the investors’ interests remain safeguarded.

[**Art. 47** Inclusion of derivatives](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_47) 

[1] In complying with the statutory and regulatory maximum and minimum limits, and in particular the regulations on risk diversification, underlying equivalents as set out in Annex 1 are decisive. 

[2] A minimum limit may be temporarily undercut with exposure-reducing derivatives purchased as part of a hedging strategy if the interests of investors remain safeguarded.

[3] Derivative components are to be taken into account with the capital requirement under Article 35. 

[**Art. 48** Inclusion of claims against counterparties at the maximum limits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_48) 

[1] Claims against counterparties arising from derivative transactions must be calculated on the basis of the current positive replacement values.

[2] Positive and negative replacement values arising from transactions in derivatives with the same counterparty may be netted if a netting agreement exists that meets the current legal requirements and is legally enforceable.

[3] Claims arising from derivative transactions against a central counterparty of an exchange or another regulated market open to the public must not be taken into account if:


|    a. such a unit is subject to an appropriate supervisory body; and  
|    b. the derivatives and collateral are subject to daily marking to market and daily margining.

[**Art. 49** Disclosure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_49) 

[1] If the use of derivatives is permitted for the management of a securities fund, such derivatives must be described in the fund regulations and the prospectus.

[2] The prospectus must indicate whether the derivatives are used as part of the investment strategy or solely to hedge investment positions. In addition, the prospectus must explain how the use of derivatives affects the risk profile of the securities fund.

[3] The fund regulations and prospectus must state which risk assessment process is applied to the securities fund. The risk assessment process must also be described in the prospectus. If the model approach is used, the gross overall exposure to derivatives must be shown. If the relative VaR approach is used, the benchmark portfolio must be disclosed in the prospectus. 

[4] If a securities fund exhibits increased volatility or leverage due to the use of derivatives, special reference must be made to this in the prospectus and advertising material.

[5] Reference must be made to the counterparty risks of derivatives in the prospectus.

### [Section 4 Management of Collateral](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#tit_1/chap_1/sec_4)

(Art. 76 para. 2 and Art. 80 para. 4 CISO)

[**Art. 50** Scope of application](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_50) 

Assets received as collateral as part of investment techniques or OTC transactions must satisfy the requirements of this section.

[**Art. 51** Requirements for collateral](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_51) 

Only collateral that meets the following requirements may be accepted:


|    a. It is highly liquid and is traded at a transparent price on an exchange or other regulated market open to the public. It can be disposed of at short notice at a price close to the valuation undertaken prior to sale.  
|    b. It is valued at least on each trading day. Where price volatility is high, suitable conservative security margins must be applied.  
|    c. It is not issued by the counterparty or by a company that belongs to or is dependent on the counterparty’s group.  
|    d. The credit quality of the issuer is high.

[**Art. 52** Management of collateral](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_52) 

The fund management company, SICAV or their agents must comply with the following duties and requirements when managing the collateral:


|    a. They must diversify the collateral appropriately in terms of countries, markets and issuers. Appropriate diversification of issuers is deemed to have been achieved if the collateral of a single issuer held does not correspond to more than 20 percent of the net asset value. Deviation from this rule is permitted if the collateral meets the requirements of Article 83 paragraph 1 CISO or the approval conditions set out in Article 83 paragraph 2 CISO are met. If collateral is provided by more than one counterparty, an aggregate perspective must be ensured.  
|    b. They must be able to obtain power of disposal over, and authority to dispose of, the collateral received at any time in the event of default by the counterparty, without involving the counterparty or obtaining its consent.  
|    c. They may not re-lend, re-pledge, sell or reinvest collateral pledged or transferred to them or use it as part of a repurchase transaction or to hedge obligations arising from derivative financial instruments. They may only use cash collateral received in the corresponding currency as liquid assets or invest it in high-quality government bonds and directly or indirectly in short-term money market instruments or use it as a reverse repo.  
|    d. If they accept collateral representing more than 30 percent of the fund assets, they must ensure that the liquidity risks can be captured and monitored appropriately. Regular stress tests must be carried out that take account of both normal and exceptional liquidity conditions. The controls carried out must be documented.  
|    e. They must take account of the risks associated with the management of collateral in their risk management process.  
|    f. They must be in a position to attribute any uncovered claims remaining after the realisation of collateral to the securities funds whose assets were the subject of the underlying transactions.

[**Art. 53** Collateral strategy](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_53) 

[1] The fund management company, SICAV and their agents must have in place a collateral strategy that:


|    a. provides for appropriate security margins;   
|    b. is geared to all types of assets received as collateral; and   
|    c. takes account of characteristics of the collateral such as volatility and the default risk of the issuer.

[2] They must document the collateral strategy.

[**Art. 54** Safekeeping of collateral](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_54) 

[1] The collateral received must be kept at the custodian bank.

[2] Safekeeping by a supervised third-party custodian on behalf of the fund management company is permitted provided that:


|    a. ownership of the collateral is not transferred; and  
|    b. the third-party custodian is independent of the counterparty.

[3] In the case of collateral delivered to a counterparty, a custodian appointed by the latter, or a central counterparty, the custodian bank must ensure that transactions are settled in a secure manner and in line with the agreements.

[**Art. 55** Prospectus](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_55) 

The prospectus of the securities fund must contain appropriate information on the collateral strategy, in particular details of:


|    a. the permitted types of collateral;  
|    b. the required level of collateralisation;  
|    c. the determination of security margins;  
|    d. the investment strategy and the risks in the event that cash collateral is reinvested.

|    a. the principles regarding the transfer of the relevant documents and further information by the master fund to the feeder fund;  
|    b. the master fund’s duty of disclosure to the feeder fund regarding the delegation of tasks to third parties;  
|    c. the violations of statutory and contractual provisions which the master fund is required to report to the feeder fund and the form and timing of such reports;  
|    d. the duty of the master fund to inform the feeder fund of the overall exposure arising from derivative financial instruments;  
|    e. the master fund’s duty of disclosure to the feeder fund if it concludes additional agreements regarding the exchange of information with third parties;  
|    f. the ways in which the feeder fund may invest in the master fund as well as details of the costs and expenses to be borne by the feeder fund;  
|    g. the principles and arrangements for implementing the measures set out in paragraph 4;  
|    h. the arrangements for reporting the deferral of issues and redemptions and for reporting errors in the setting of prices by the master fund;  
|    i. the principles for reconciling the audit reports of the master fund and feeder fund.

[3] If the master fund and feeder fund are managed by the same fund management company or SICAV, the agreement on cooperation and duties of disclosure may be replaced by internal regulations. These must contain measures to prevent conflicts of interest. In all other respects, the internal regulations must meet the requirements set out in paragraph 2 letters f–i.

[4] The master fund and feeder fund shall take measures to coordinate the schedules for calculating and publishing the net asset value in order to prevent market timing and possibilities for arbitrage.

|    d. other points that are necessary for the cooperation between the custodian banks. 

[3] When exchanging data, the custodian banks shall comply with their statutory and contractual obligations regarding the disclosure of data and data protection.

[**Art. 62** Duties of the audit company](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_62) 

[1] In its short-form report for the feeder fund, the audit company shall take account of the short-form report for the master fund. If the master fund and feeder fund have different accounting years, the master fund shall compile an interim financial statement as of the reporting date of the feeder fund.

[1] Following the announcement of the dissolution of the master fund, the feeder fund shall without delay defer repayments. Within one month following the announcement of the dissolution of the master fund, it shall submit to FINMA a report / an application regarding:


|    a. the dissolution of the master fund;  
|    b. an amendment to the fund contract or investment regulations due to the change of master fund; or   
|    c. an amendment to the fund contract or investment regulations due to the conversion into a non-feeder fund.

[2] The liquidation proceeds of the master fund may not be paid out before the applications set out in paragraph 1 letters b and c have been approved unless they are reinvested solely for the purpose of efficient liquidity management until the time of approval.

[**Art. 64** Merger, conversion and transfer of assets](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/707/en#art_64) 

[1] If the master fund decides on a merger, conversion or transfer of assets, the feeder fund must, within a month of the announcement being made by the master fund, notify FINMA whether it:


|    a. is dissolving itself;  
|    b. intends to retain the same master fund;  
|    c. is switching to another master fund; or
