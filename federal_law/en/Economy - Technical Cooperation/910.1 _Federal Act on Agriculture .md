The Federal Assembly of the Swiss Confederation,

based on Articles 45, 46 paragraph 1, 102–104, 120, 123 and 147 of the Federal Constitution,

and having considered the Federal Council Dispatch dated 26 June 1996,

decrees:

# [Title 1 General Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#tit_1)

[**Art. 1** Aim](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_1) 

The Confederation shall ensure that, through sustainable, market-orientated production, the agricultural sector makes a significant contribution towards:


|    a. the reliable provision of the population with foodstuffs;  
|    b. preserving natural resources;  
|    c. the upkeep of the countryside;  
|    d. encouraging decentralised settlement;  
|    e. guaranteeing animal welfare.

[**Art. 2** Federal measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_2) 

[1] The Confederation shall take measures, in particular:


|    a. to create favourable conditions for the production and sale of agricultural products;  
|    b. to pay for public and ecological services provided by farms through direct subsidies;  
|    b[bis]. to promote the sustainable use of natural resources and animal and climate friendly production;   
|    c. to support the development of agriculture in a socially acceptable manner;  
|    d. to support structural improvements;  
|    e. to promote agricultural research and advisory services as well as plant and animal breeding;  
|    f. to regulate plant protection and the use of aids to production.

[2] These federal measures are conditional on a reasonable degree of self-help and are coordinated with regional policy instruments.

3 They support a joint strategy for quality in agriculture and the food industry.

4 They are based on the principle of self-sufficiency with regard to food, taking into account consumers’ needs for high-quality, varied and sustainable domestic products.

5 Support measures that are likely to distort competition to the detriment of trade and industry are excluded. Procedures are governed by Article 89*a*. The Federal Council regulates the details.

[**Art. 3** Definition and scope of application](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_3) 

[1] The term agriculture includes:


|    a. products from arable and livestock farming;  
|    b. the preparation, storage and sale of the corresponding products on the farm;  
|    c. the management of areas of near-natural land.

[1bis] The measures in Parts 5 and 6 apply to agricultural activities. They are conditional on an activity in line with the principle of paragraph 1, letters a­–c.

[2] The measures in Part 2 Chapter 1 and those indicated in Parts 5 to 7 apply to horticultural businesses.

[3] The measures in Part 2 Chapter 1, Part 5 and Part 7 Chapter 2 apply to professional fishing and fish farming.

[4] The measures listed in Part 2 Chapter 1, Part 6 and Part 7 Chapter 2 apply to beekeeping.

[**Art. 4** Difficult production and living conditions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_4) 

[1] Difficult production and living conditions, in particular in mountain and upland areas, must be adequately taken into account in the application of this Act.

[2] The Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG) shall divide all farmed land into zones according to the degree of difficulty and keep a production register.

[3] The Federal Council shall set the criteria for determining such zones.

[**Art. 5** Incomes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_5) 

[1] The measures in this Act aim to ensure that farms run on a sustainable basis and which are economically efficient can achieve incomes over a period of several years that are comparable to incomes in other sectors in the same region.

[2] If incomes fall clearly below a comparable level, the Federal Council shall introduce temporary measures to improve the situation.

[3] Other branches of trade and industry, the economic situation of workers outside the agricultural sector and the state of the federal coffers must also be taken into account.

[**Art. 6** Framework for payments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_6) 

Funding for the most important areas of activity shall be approved for a maximum period of four years on the basis of a Federal Council dispatch with a simple federal decree.

# [Title 2 General Conditions for Production and Sales](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#tit_2)

[**Art. 7** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_7) 

[1] The Confederation shall draw up general conditions for the production and sale of agricultural products so as to ensure that the agricultural sector can operate sustainably and cost-efficiently while at the same time achieving maximum market prices from the sale of its products.

[2] At the same time it shall take into account the necessity for product safety, consumer protection and reliable food supplies for the country.

## [Chapter 1 General Economic Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#tit_2/chap_1)

### [Section 1 Quality, Sales Promotion and Market Relief](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_1)

[**Art. 8** Self-help](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_8) 

[1] Producers’ organisations or the corresponding branches are responsible for promoting quality and sales, as well as for ensuring that production and supply are adapted to the demands of the market.

1bis The branch organisations may draw up standard contracts.

[2] A branch organisation is an association of producers of individual products or product groups with processors and, in some cases, with traders.

[**Art. 8***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_8_a) [Guideline prices](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_8_a) 

[1] The organisations of producers of individual products or product groups or the corresponding branches may publish guideline prices at a national or regional level to which suppliers and buyers have agreed.

[2] Guideline prices must be set according to different levels of quality.

[3] No individual business may be forced to comply with guideline prices.

[4] No guideline prices may be set for retail sales.

[**Art. 9**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_9) [Support for self-help measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_9) 

[1] Insofar as self-help measures mentioned in Article 8 paragraph 1 come under threat from businesses that do not comply with the collectively agreed measures, the Federal Council may introduce regulations if the organisation:


|    a. is representative;  
|    b. is not active in production, processing or sales;  
|    c. has approved the self-help measures by a clear majority.

[2] The Federal Council may oblige non-members of an organisation to contribute towards funding self-help measures mentioned in Article 8 paragraph 1 if the conditions outlined in paragraph 1 are met and the organisation receives contributions from its members for funding self-help measures. Such contributions may not be used to cover the organisation’s administrative expenses.

[3] With regard to adapting production and supply to market demand, the Federal Council may issue regulations solely in case of exceptional developments that are not caused by structural problems.

[4] Products sold directly to the public may not be made subject to the regulations mentioned in paragraph 1, and farmers who sell direct to the public may not be made liable for contributions under paragraph 2 based on the volume of products thus sold.

[**Art. 10**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_10) [Quality regulations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_10) 

The Federal Council may issue regulations on quality as well as on the methods used to obtain agricultural products and their processing if such regulations are required for their export or for compliance with Switzerland’s international obligations or with international standards that are important for Swiss agriculture.

[**Art. 11**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_11) [Improving quality and sustainability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_11) 

[1] The Confederation shall support joint measures adopted by producers, processors or traders that are aimed at improving or ensuring the quality and sustainability of agricultural products and goods processed from them, as well as of processing methods.

[2] Such measures must:


|    a. promote innovation or cooperation throughout the product chain;  
|    b. foresee the participation of producers and be first and foremost of benefit to them.

[3] Support may be provided in particular for:


|    a. preliminary studies;  
|    b. the initial implementation of the measures;  
|    c. the inclusion of producers in projects aimed at improving quality and sustainability.

4 The Federal Council shall draw up requirements for such support.

[**Art. 12** Sales promotion](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_12) 

[1] The Confederation may subsidise national or regional measures introduced by producers, processors or traders that are aimed at promoting the sale of Swiss agricultural products within the country and abroad.

[2] For this purpose it may also support efforts to increase awareness of public services provided by the agricultural sector.

[3] It may also coordinate subsidised measures within Switzerland and abroad, for example by devising a common identity.

[4] The Federal Council shall draw up the criteria for the allocation of subsidies.

[**Art. 13** Market relief](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_13) 

[1] In order to avoid slumps in the price of agricultural products, the Confederation may contribute to the cost of temporary measures, in exceptional circumstances, in order to relieve the market. It may not subsidise the reduction of surpluses due to structural factors.

[2] Federal subsidies are normally conditional on appropriate contributions from the cantons or from interested organisations.

### [Section 2 Labelling](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_2)

[**Art. 14** General provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_14) 

[1] In the interests of credibility and to promote quality and sales, the Federal Council may issue regulations concerning the labelling of agricultural products and processed products which:


|    a. are manufactured using certain methods;  
|    b. have other specific characteristics;  
|    c. come from mountain areas;  
|    d. can be distinguished by their origin;  
|    e. are manufactured without the use of certain procedures or do not display specific characteristics;  
|    f. are manufactured according to special criteria for sustainable development.

[2] Labelling such products according to these regulations is voluntary.

[3] The provisions of legislation on gene technology and foodstuffs are reserved.

[4] The Federal Council may devise official symbols for labelling under the terms of this Article and Article 63 paragraph 1 letters a and b and may make their use mandatory.

[5] It is mandatory to use these symbols in sales promotion campaigns involving measures mentioned in Article 12.

[**Art. 15** Production methods and specific product characteristics](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_15) 

[1] The Federal Council shall stipulate:


|    a. the requirements that must be met by the products and production methods, in particular those that claim to be ecological;  
|    b. monitoring procedures.

[2] Products may only be labelled as organic if the entire farm where they are produced is run organically. The Federal Council may in particular allow exceptions for farms with permanent crops insofar as the integrity of the organic production and its ability to be checked is not compromised.

[3] The Federal Council may recognise the guidelines issued by organisations if they include the requirements mentioned under paragraph 1 letter a.

[4] The Federal Council may recognise labelling for foreign products if it is based on equivalent requirements.

[**Art. 16** Designations of origin and geographical](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_16) [indications](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_16) 

[1] The Federal Council shall set up a register of designations of origin and geographical indications.

[2] In particular it shall regulate:


|    a. entitlement to registration;  
|    b. the requirements for registration, in particular requirements regarding product specifications;  
|    c. appeal and registration procedures;  
|    d. monitoring.

[2bis] Swiss and foreign designations of origin and geographical indications may be entered in the register.

[3] Registered designations of origin or geographical indications may not be used as generic names. Generic names may not be registered as designations of origin or as geographical indications.

[4] If the name of a canton or a locality is used in a designation of origin or a geographical indication, it must be verified that registering the product complies with any relevant cantonal regulations.

[5] Registered designations of origin or geographical indications may not be registered as product trade marks if the terms of paragraph 7 apply.

[5bis] If a trade mark is filed that contains a designation of origin or geographical indication that is identical or similar to a designation of origin or geographical indication that has been filed for registration for identical or comparable goods, the trade mark examination procedure shall be suspended until a legally binding decision has been taken on the application to register the designation of origin or the geographical indication.

[6] Any person who uses a registered designation of origin or geographical indication for identical or similar agricultural products or goods processed from them must comply with the regulations indicated in paragraph 2 letter b. This does not apply to the use of trade marks that are identical or similar to a registered designation of origin or geographical indication and which have been deposited or registered in good faith or to which the right of use has been acquired in good faith:


|    a. before 1 January 1996; or  
|    b. before the name of the registered designation of origin or geographical indication came under protection under the terms of this Act or on another legal basis, insofar as none of the grounds for nullity or expiry indicated in the Trademark Protection Act of 28 August 1992 can be demonstrated for the trade mark.

[6bis] In assessing the legality of the use of a trade mark acquired in good faith under the terms of paragraph 6, particular attention should be given to the question of whether there is any risk of deception or a breach of genuine competition.

[7] Registered designations of origin and geographical indications are protected in particular against:


|    a. any commercial use in relation to other products which takes advantage of the reputation of a protected designation;  
|    b. any form of usurpation, imitation or counterfeiting.

[**Art. 16***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_16_a) [Indications of particular characteristics or production methods](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_16_a) 

[1] Agricultural products or products processed from them may be labelled with information about their particular characteristics or the production methods used that come under the regulations (environmentally friendly production, proof of organic production or animal-friendly livestock management) or with information concerning the regulations.

[2] In particular, any such information must comply with the regulations on protection against deception under the terms of legislation on foodstuffs.

[**Art. 16***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_16_b) [Protection of designations of origin and geographical indications outside Switzerland](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_16_b) 

[1] The Confederation shall support the branch, producers’ and processors’ organisations in protecting labels of Swiss origin and geographical indications outside Switzerland.

[2] It may take on part of the expenses accruing to Swiss missions abroad if the latter are asked by branch, producers’ or processors’ organisations to protect designations of origin or a geographical indications.

### [Section 3 Imports](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_3)

[**Art. 17** Import duties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_17) 

When import duties are set, domestic supply and potential sales of similar domestic products must be taken into account.

[**Art. 18** Measures regarding products obtained using production methods banned in Switzerland](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_18) 

[1] Unless such action breaches international commitments, the Federal Council shall introduce regulations concerning the declaration of products that have been obtained using methods that are banned in Switzerland; it shall raise import duties or ban the import of such products.

[2] Under the terms of paragraph 1, banned production methods include those methods which endanger:


|    a. the life or health of human beings, animals or plants; or  
|    b. the environment.

[**Art. 19** Customs tariffs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_19) 

Unless this Act provides otherwise, responsibility and procedures for setting customs tariffs are governed by customs legislation.

[**Art. 19***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_19_a) [Specific use of income from customs duties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_19_a) 

[1] The income from customs duties on agricultural products and foodstuffs for the period 2009–2016 is earmarked for a specific purpose, namely to fund accompanying measures in relation to the implementation of a free-trade agreement with the European Union regarding agricultural products and foodstuffs or of a WTO agreement.

[2] In particular, the funding must be used for accompanying measures to support agriculture.

[3] If negotiations are unsuccessful, the Federal Council shall release the funds for other uses.

[4] If the proposed accompanying measures require less funding than that earmarked for this specific purpose, the Federal Council may release the remaining amount for other uses.

[**Art. 20** Threshold prices](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_20) 

[1] The Federal Council may introduce threshold prices for individual products. The terms of Article 17 apply.

[2] The threshold price corresponds to the target import price, comprising the price franco Swiss border and customs duties as well as charges with a similar effect. The Federal Council shall decide how the price franco Swiss border, untaxed, is calculated.

[3] The Federal Council may set the threshold price for a group of products. The Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research (EAER) shall set a guideline import value for individual products.

[4] The EAER shall decide to what extent the sum of the customs duty rate and price franco Swiss border, untaxed, may deviate from the threshold price before the customs duty rate has to be adjusted (band).

[5] The FOAG shall set the customs duty rate for products with a threshold price in such a way that the import price lies within the band.

[6] Insofar as the sale of similar domestic products does not come under threat, the EAER may set the customs duty rate lower than indicated in paragraph 5.

[7] The customs duty rates may not entail any elements of protection *vis-à-vis* industry.

[**Art. 21** Tariff quotas](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_21) 

[1] Tariff quotas for agricultural products are set out in Annex 2 to the Customs Tariff Act of 9 October 1986 (General Tariff).

[2] The Federal Council may modify tariff quotas and, if applicable, their staggered introduction as part of the General Tariff.

[3] The terms of Article 17 apply to the setting and adjustment of tariff quotas as well as to their staggered introduction.

[4] If market conditions require the frequent adjustment of tariff quotas, the Federal Council may delegate responsibility for adjusting tariff quotas and for staggering their introduction to the EAER or to an agency that is part of the Federal Department.

[5] The provisions of this Act apply mutatis mutandis to additional tariff quotas as defined under the terms of Article 4 paragraph 3 letter c of the Customs Tariff Act of 9 October 1986.

[**Art. 22** Allocation of tariff quotas](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_22) 

[1] Competition must be maintained in the allocation of tariff quotas.

[2] The authorities responsible shall allocate tariff quotas according to the following procedures and criteria in particular:


|    a. by auction;  
|    b. according to domestic purchasing obligations;  
|    c. on the basis of the quantity requested;  
|    d. according to the order of receipt of applications for permits;  
|    e. according to the order of assessments;  
|    f. on the basis of the applicant’s imports to date.

[3] Promotion of Swiss production as indicated in paragraph 2 letter b is defined as the purchase of similar goods produced in Switzerland and of standard trade quality.

[4] In order to avoid abuse, the Federal Council may exclude certain importers from entitlement.

[5] The Federal Council may delegate responsibility for setting the criteria for the allocation of tariff quotas to the EAER.

[6] The allocation of tariff quotas shall be made public.

[**Art. 23** Compensatory payments and charges](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_23) 

[1] If the allocation of a tariff quota share is dependent on promotion of Swiss production (Art. 22 paragraph 2 letter b), the Federal Council may decide on appropriate compensatory payments or charges if:


|    a. such promotion is not necessary in view of its purpose; or  
|    b. it is impossible for the importer to promote Swiss production or doing so would lead to unreasonable hardship.

[2] Compensatory payments or charges must be set in such a way that they balance out the advantages gained by the importer from not having to promote Swiss production.

[**Art. 24** Import permits, protective measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_24) 

[1] In order to gather statistics on imports, the Federal Council may decide that certain agricultural products require an import permit.

[2] In view of the protective measures that the Federal Council may introduce, the EAER is authorised to suspend the issuing of import permits until the Federal Council has taken a decision.

[3] The application of protection clauses in international agreements on the agricultural sector are governed by Article 11 of the Customs Tariff Act of 9 October 1986.

[4] Paragraph 2 does not apply to the application of protection clauses in international agreements under:


|    a. Article 1 of the Federal Act of 25 June 1982 on International Trade Measures; and  
|    b. Article 7 of the Customs Tariff Act of 9 October 1986.

[**Art. 25** Voluntary contributions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_25) 

[1] Where the branches in question pay taxes on imported agricultural products in favour of domestic products on a voluntary basis, the Federal Council may prescribe the maximum rate for such taxes in order to comply with international commitments. It may delegate this task to the EAER.

[2] If the maximum rate for such taxes is reduced because of international agreements, the taxes are modified at the same rate as customs duties. Deviation from this rule is allowed in justified cases.

[**Art. 77** Bridging subsidies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/3033_3033_3033/en#art_77) 

[1] Bridging subsidies are paid to ensure development under socially acceptable terms.

[2] Bridging subsidies are based on the approved credits minus subsidies under Articles 71–76, 77*a* and 77*b*, and compensatory payments under Article 62*a* of the Federal Act on the Protection of Waters of 24 January 1991.

[3] Bridging subsidies are paid per farm. The subsidy for the individual farm is based on the difference between the general direct payments before the change of system and the subsidies according to articles 71 paragraph 1 letters a–c and 72 after the change of system. The difference is determined on the basis of the structure of the farm before the change of system. 

[4] The Federal Council shall decide on:


|    a. the calculation of subsidies for individual farms;  
|    b. the modalities in the case of transfer of ownership of farms and major structural changes;  
|    c. limits in relation to the taxable income and wealth of the farmers above which subsidies are reduced or refused, a higher limit being set for married farmers.
