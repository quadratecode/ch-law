[**Art. 2** Definition of works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_2) 

[1] Works are literary and artistic intellectual creations with individual character, irrespective of their value or purpose.

[3bis]Photographic depictions and depictions of three-dimensional objects produced by a process similar to that of photography are considered works, even if they do not have individual character.

[4] Drafts, titles and parts of works, insofar as they are intellectual creations with an individual character, are also protected.

[**Art. 3** Derivative works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_3) 

[1] Derivative works are intellectual creations with individual character that are based upon pre-existing works, whereby the individual character of the latter remains identifiable.

[2] Such works include, in particular, translations as well as audio-visual and other adaptations. 

[3] Derivative works are protected as works in their own right.

[4] The protection of the works used in the derivative work remains reserved.

[**Art. 4** Collected works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_4) 

[1] Collections are protected as works in their own right insofar as they are intellectual creations with individual character with regard to their selection and arrangement. 

[2] Works included in a collected work may be protected individually.

[**Art. 5** Works excluded from protection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_5) 

[1] Copyright does not protect:


|    a. acts, ordinances, international treaties and other official enactments;  
|    b. means of payment;

## [Chapter 2 Author](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#tit_2/chap_2)

[**Art. 6** Definition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_6) 

The author is the natural person who has created the work.

[**Art. 7** Joint authorship](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_7) 

[1] Where two or more persons have contributed as authors to the creation of a work, copyright belongs to all such persons jointly.

[2] Unless they have agreed otherwise, they may only use the work with the consent of all authors; consent may not be withheld for reasons contrary to the principles of good faith.

[3] Each joint author may independently bring an action for infringement, but may only ask for relief for the benefit of all.

[4] Where the individual contributions may be separated and there is no agreement to the contrary, each joint author may use his own contribution independently provided such use does not impair the exploitation of the joint work.

[**Art. 8** Presumption of authorship](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_8) 

[1] Unless proven otherwise, the author is the person whose name, pseudonym or distinctive sign appears on the copies or the publication of the work.

[2] As long as the author is not named or remains unknown in the case of a pseudonym or a distinctive sign, the person who is the editor of the work may exercise the copyright. Where such person is also not named, the person who has published the work may exercise the copyright.

[2] The author has the exclusive right to decide whether, when, how and under what author’s designation his own work is published for the first time.

[3] A work is considered to be published when it has been made available for the first time by the author, or with his consent, to a large number of persons not constituting a private circle as defined in Article 19 paragraph 1 letter a.

[**Art. 10** Use of the work](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_10)

[1] The author has the exclusive right to decide:


|    a. whether, when and how the work may be altered;  
|    b. whether, when and how the work may be used to create a derivative work or may be included in a collected work.

[2] Even where a third party is authorised by contract or law to alter the work or to use it to create a derivative work, the author may oppose any distortion of the work that is a violation of his personal rights.

[3] It is permissible to use existing works for the creation of parodies or other comparable variations on the work.

### [Section 2 Relationship between Authorship and Ownership of Copies of the Work](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_2)


[**Art. 12** Principle of exhaustion](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_12) 

[1] Where the author has transferred the rights to a copy of a work or has consented to such a transfer, these rights may subsequently be further transferred or the copy otherwise distributed.

[1bis] Copies of audio-visual works may not be further transferred or rented as long as the author is thereby impaired in exercising his right of performance (Art. 10 para. 2 let. c).

[2] Where the author has transferred the rights to a computer program or has consented to such transfer, such a program may subsequently be used or further transferred.

[3] Works of architecture that have been constructed may be altered by the owner; Article 11 paragraph 2 remains reserved.

[**Art. 13** Rental of copies of works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_13) 

[1] Any person who rents or otherwise makes available for a fee copies of literary or artistic works owes remuneration to the author.

[2] No obligation to pay remuneration exists for:


|    a. works of architecture;  
|    b. copies of works of applied art;  
|    c. copies of works rented or lent for a contractually agreed use of copyright.

[3] Claims for remuneration may only be asserted by the approved collective rights management organisations (Art. 40 and seq.).

[4] This Article does not apply to computer programs. The exclusive right under Article 10 paragraph 3 remains reserved.

[**Art. 13***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_13_a) [Making available of audio-visual works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_13_a) 

[1]Any person who lawfully makes an audio-visual work available in such a way that persons may access it from a place and at a time chosen by them owes remuneration to the authors who created the audio-visual work.

[2]No remuneration is owed if:


|    the author or their heirs personally exploit the exclusive right to making the work available; or   
|    the audio-visual work is one of the following:   
|    company profile films, industrial films, advertising or promotional films, computer games, services or commissioned works by broadcasting organisations or other works in the field of journalism that are created under an employment contract or that are commissioned,   
|    archived works of broadcasting organisations (Art. 22*a*),   
|    orphan works (Art. 22*b*). 



[3]The right to remuneration is inalienable and unwaivable and only the authors are entitled to claim it; it substitutes any remuneration for the contractually agreed use of the audio-visual work. It may only be asserted by the approved collective rights management organisations.

[4]Authors of an audio-visual work which was not produced by a person domiciled or with a registered office in Switzerland only have a right to remuneration if the country in which the audio-visual work was produced also provides for a collectively managed remuneration right for authors for the making available of the work.

[5]This article does not apply to music contained in audio-visual works. The authors of musical works have a right to an equitable share of the proceeds from their collectively managed exclusive rights.

[**Art. 14** Author’s right of access and exhibition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_14) 

[1] Any person who owns or is in possession of a copy of a work must provide access thereto to the author to the extent necessary for the latter to exercise the copyright and insofar as no legitimate interest of the owner precludes such access. 

[2] The author may require that a copy of the work be lent to him for an exhibition in Switzerland if an overriding interest can be proven.

[3] The loan may be subject to the provision of security for the intact return of the copy of the work. Where the copy of the work cannot be returned intact, the author is liable regardless of fault.

[**Art. 15** Protection against destruction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_15) 

[1] Where the owner of an original work of which no further copies exist has reason to assume that the author of the work has a legitimate interest in its preservation, he may not destroy the work without first offering to return it to the author. The owner may not request more than the material value of the work.

[2] Where it is not possible to return the work, the owner must make it possible for the author to reproduce the original in an appropriate manner.

[3] For works of architecture, the author only has the right to photograph the work and to require that copies of the plans be handed to him at his own expense.

## [Chapter 4 Assignment of Rights; Debt Enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#tit_2/chap_4)

[**Art. 16** Assignment of rights](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_16) 

[1] Copyright is assignable or may be inherited.

[2] The assignment of a right subsisting in the copyright does not include the assignment of other partial rights, unless such was agreed.

[3][]The assignment of the ownership of a copy of a work does not include the right to exploit the copyright, even in the case of an original work.

[**Art. 17** Rights to computer programs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_17) 

Where a computer program has been created under an employment contract in the course of discharging professional duties and in fulfilling contractual obligations, the employer alone shall be entitled to exercise the exclusive rights of use.

[**Art. 18** Debt enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_18) 

The rights referred to in Article 10 paragraphs 2 and 3 and in Article 11 are subject to debt enforcement insofar as the author has already exercised them and the work has already been published with the consent of the author.

## [Chapter 5 Exceptions to Copyright](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#tit_2/chap_5)

[**Art. 19** Private use](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_19) 

[1] Published works may be used for private use. Private use means:


|    a. any personal use of a work or use within a circle of persons closely connected to each other, such as relatives or friends;  
|    b. any use of a work by a teacher and his class for educational purposes;  
|    c. the copying of a work in enterprises, public administrations, institutions, commissions and similar bodies for internal information or documentation.

[2] Persons entitled to make copies of a work for private use may also have them made by third parties subject to paragraph 3; libraries, other public institutions and businesses that make copying apparatus available to their users are also deemed third parties within the meaning of this paragraph.

[3] The following are not permitted outside the private sphere defined in paragraph 1 letter a:


|    a. the complete or substantial copying of a work obtainable commercially;  
|    b. the copying of works of art;  
|    c. the copying of musical scores;  
|    d. the fixation of recitations, performances or presentations of a work on blank media.

[3bis] Copies which are made by accessing works that are lawfully made available are neither subject to the restriction of private use under this Article nor are they included in the claims for remuneration under Article 20.

[4] This Article does not apply to computer programs.

[**Art. 20** Remuneration for private use](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_20) 

[1] The use of the work within a circle of persons under Article 19 paragraph 1 letter a does not give rise to a right of remuneration subject to paragraph 3.

[2] Any person who reproduces works in any manner for private use under Article 19 paragraph 1 letter b or letter c, or any person who does so as a third party under Article 19 paragraph 2 owes remuneration to the author.

[3] Any person who produces or imports blank media suitable for the fixation of works owes remuneration to the author for the use of the works under Article 19.

[4] Claims for remuneration may only be asserted by the authorised collective rights management organisations.

[**Art. 21** Decoding of computer programs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_21) 

[1] Any person who has the right to use a computer program may obtain, either personally or through a third party, necessary information on the interfaces by decoding the program code using independently developed programs.

[2] The interface information obtained by decoding the program code may only be used for the development, maintenance and use of interoperable computer programs insofar as neither the normal exploitation of the program nor the legitimate interests of the owner of the rights are unreasonably prejudiced.

[**Art. 22** Dissemination of broadcast works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_22) 

[1] The right to make broadcast works perceptible simultaneously and without alteration or to rebroadcast such works within the framework of the retransmission of a broadcast programme may only be asserted by the authorised collective rights management organisations.

[2] The retransmission of works by means of technical equipment that is intended to serve a small number of receivers, such as installations in a multiple-family dwelling or in a residential complex, is permitted.

[3] This Article does not apply to the rebroadcasting of subscription television programmes or of programmes that cannot be received in Switzerland.

[**Art. 22***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_22_a) [Use of broadcasting organisations’ archived works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_22_a) 

[1] The following rights to archived works of broadcasting organisations’ under the Federal Act of 24 March 2006 on Radio and Television may only be asserted by the authorised collective rights management organisations, subject to paragraph 3:


|    a. the right to broadcast the unmodified complete archived work or an excerpt thereof;  
|    b. the right to make available the unmodified complete work, or an excerpt thereof, in such a way that persons may access it from a place or at a time individually chosen by them;   
|    c. the reproduction rights necessary to exercise the uses under letters a and b.

[2] A broadcasting organisations’ archived work means a work fixed on a phonogram or audio-visual fixation which was created by a broadcasting organisation under its own editorial responsibility and at its own expense or by a third party at the sole request and expense of the broadcasting organisation and which was first broadcast at least ten years previously. In the event that other works or parts of works are integrated into an archived work, paragraph 1 also applies to the assertion of rights to this work or partial work insofar as these do not significantly determine the unique character of the archived works.

[3] To the extent that the rights under paragraph 1 and their remuneration are regulated in a contract prior to the first broadcast or within ten years thereafter, the contractual provisions apply exclusively. Paragraph 1 does not apply to the broadcasting organisations' rights under Article 37. The broadcasting organisations and the third parties involved must provide information regarding the contractual agreement to the collective rights management organisation upon request.

[**Art. 22***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_22_b) [Use of orphan works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_22_b) 

[1] A work is considered to be orphaned if the holders of the rights to the work remain unknown or cannot be found following an appropriate research effort. 

[2] The rights to the orphan work under Article 10 may only be asserted by authorised collective rights management organisations if the work is used on the basis of a copy of a work which:


|    a. is contained in collections held by public or publicly accessible libraries, educational institutions, museums, collections and archives or in archive collections of broadcasting organisations; and  
|    b. was produced, copied, or made available in Switzerland, or handed over to an institution within the meaning of letter a.

[3] Orphan works are considered to be published. If other works or partial works are integrated into an orphan work, paragraph 2 also applies to the assertion of the rights to these works or partial works insofar as these do not significantly determine the unique character of the archived works.

[4] The rights holders have a right to remuneration for the use of the work. This may not exceed the remuneration provided for in the distribution regulations of the relevant collective rights management organisation for the use of the work.

[5] Article 43*a* applies to the use of a larger number of works on the basis of copies of works from collections under paragraph 2 letter a.

[6] If no rights holders present themselves within 10 years, the proceeds of exploitation, by way of derogation from Article 48 paragraph 2, shall be used in their entirety for social welfare purposes and for the appropriate promotion of culture.

[**Art. 22***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_22_c) [Making available broadcast musical works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_22_c) 

[1] The right to make non-theatrical works of music contained in a broadcast available through a radio or television programme may only be asserted by the authorised collective rights management organisations if:


|    a. the broadcast was primarily produced by the broadcasting organisation or at its request;  
|    b. the broadcast was dedicated to a non-musical topic which took precedence over the music and was announced prior to the broadcast in the usual manner; and  
|    c. making it available does not impair the sale of music on phonograms or through online offers by third parties.

[2] Subject to the requirements of paragraph 1, the right of reproduction for the purpose of making available may only be asserted by the authorised collective rights management organisations.

[**Art. 23** Compulsory licence for the manufacture of phonograms](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_23) 

[1] If a musical work, with or without lyrics, has been fixed on a phonogram in Switzerland or abroad and has been offered, transferred or otherwise distributed in this form with the permission of the author, all manufacturers of phonograms with a commercial establishment in Switzerland may also request permission from the copyright owner to do the same in Switzerland against remuneration.

[2] The Federal Council may waive the requirement of a commercial establishment in Switzerland in the case of nationals of countries granting reciprocity.

[**Art. 24** Archive and backup copies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_24) 

[1] One copy of a work may be made in order to ensure its preservation. The original or the copy must be stored in an archive not accessible to the general public and be marked as the archive copy.

[1bis] Public and publicly accessible libraries, educational institutions, museums and archives may make those copies of the works required to secure and preserve their collections insofar as these copies are not made for financial or commercial gain.

[2] Any person entitled to use a computer program may make one backup copy thereof; this right may not be waived by contract.

[**Art. 24***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_24_a) [Temporary copies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_24_a) 

The making of temporary copies of a work is permitted if:


|    a. they are transient or incidental;  
|    b. they represent an integral and essential part of a technological process;  
|    c. their sole purpose is to enable a transmission of the work in a network between third parties by an intermediary or a lawful use of the work; and  
|    d. they have no independent economic significance.

[**Art. 24***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_24_b) [Copies for broadcasting purposes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_24_b) 

[1] If commercially available phonograms or audio-visual fixations are used for broadcasting purposes by broadcasting organisations subject to the Federal Act of 24 March 2006 on Radio and Television, the rights of reproduction of non-theatrical musical works may only be asserted by an authorised collective rights management organisation.

[2] Copies produced in accordance with paragraph 1 may neither be transferred nor otherwise distributed; they must be produced by the broadcasting organisation by means of their own facilities. They must be destroyed after they have fulfilled their purpose. Article 11 remains reserved.

[**Art. 24***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_24_c) [Use of works by persons with disabilities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_24_c)

[2] Copies under paragraph 1 may only be produced, distributed or made available for non-commercial purposes, and only for the use of persons with disabilities.

[3] Copies under paragraph 1 and copies which were produced in accordance with a corresponding legal limitation or exception in another country may be imported and exported if:


|    they are used exclusively by persons with disabilities; and   
|    they are obtained by a non-profit organisation which, as one of its main activities, provides services to persons with disabilities in the fields of education, instructional training, adaptive reading or access to information. 

[4] The author has the right to remuneration for the copying, distribution and making available of a work in a format accessible to persons with disabilities other than in the case of the production of individual copies of the work.

[5] Claims for remuneration may only be asserted by an authorised collective rights management organisation.

[**Art. 24***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_24_d) [Use of works for the purposes of scientific research](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_24_d) 

[1]For the purposes of scientific research, it is permissible to reproduce a work if the copying is due to the use of a technical process and if the works to be copied can be lawfully accessed.

[2]On conclusion of the scientific research, the copies made in accordance with this article may be retained for archiving and backup purposes.

|    abis. 50 years after production for photographic depictions and depictions of three-dimensional objects produced by a process similar to that of photography if the depictions do not have individual character;   
|    b. in the case of all other works, 70 years after the death of the author.

[3] Where it is has to be assumed that the author has been dead for more than 50 or 70 years respectively, protection no longer applies.

[4] Articles 30 and 31 do not apply to photographic depictions and depictions of three-dimensional objects produced by a process similar to that of photography if the depictions do not have individual character.

|    a. in the case of computer programs, 50 years after the death of the author;  
|    b. in the case of all other works, 70 years after the death of the author.

[**Art. 32** Calculation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_32)

[**Art. 33** Rights of performers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_33) 

[1] A performer is any natural person who performs a work or an expression of folklore or who participates artistically in the performance of such a work*.*

[2] Performers have the following exclusive right in respect of their performance or its fixation:


|    a. to make their performance perceptible in some place other than that in which it was performed, either directly or through any kind of medium, in such a way that persons may access it from a place and at a time individually chosen by them;  
|    b. to broadcast their performance by radio, television or similar method, including by wire, as well as to retransmit the broadcast performance by means of technical equipment, the provider of which is not the original broadcasting organisation;  
|    c. to fix their performance on blank media and to reproduce such fixations;  
|    d. to offer, transfer or otherwise distribute copies of their performance;  
|    e. to make their performance perceptible when they are broadcast, retransmitted or made available to the public.

[**Art. 33***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_33_a) [Moral rights of performers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_33_a) 

[1] Performers have the right to be recognised as such when they perform a work.

[2] The protection of performers from derogatory treatment of their performances is subject to Articles 28–28*l* of the Swiss Civil Code.

[**Art. 34**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_34) [Collective performance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_34) 

[1] Where two or more persons have participated artistically in a performance, they are jointly entitled to the related rights under Article 7. 

[2] Where performers appear as a group under a common name, the representative named by the performing group shall have the authority to assert the rights of the members. Insofar as the group does not name a representative, the person who produces the performance or fixes it on blank media, or who broadcasts it has the authority to assert the rights.

[3] In the case of a choral, orchestral or stage performance, use of the performance under Article 33 requires the consent of the following persons:


|    a. the soloists;  
|    b. the conductor;  
|    c. the director;  
|    d. the representative of the performing group under paragraph 2.

[4] Any person who has the right to exploit a performance on an audio-visual fixation is considered to be authorised to permit third parties to make the fixed performance available in such a way that persons may have access to it from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

[5] In the absence of the corresponding statutory or contractual provisions, the relationship between the authorised persons under paragraphs 2 and 4 and the performers whom they represent is governed by the provisions on agency without authority.

[**Art. 35** Right to remuneration for the use of phonograms and audio-visual fixations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_35) 

[1] If commercially available phonograms or audio-visual fixations are used for the purpose of broadcasting, retransmission, public reception (Article 33 para. 2 let. e) or performance, the performers have a right to remuneration.

[2] The producer of the medium thus used is entitled to an equitable share of the remuneration of the performers.

[3] Claims for remuneration may only be asserted by the authorised collective rights management organisations.

[4] Foreign performers who are not habitually resident in Switzerland only have a right to remuneration if the state of which they are a national affords a corresponding right to Swiss nationals.

[**Art. 35***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_35_a) [Making available of performances in audio-visual works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_35_a) 

[1]Any person who lawfully makes an audio-visual work available in such a way that persons may access it from a place and at a time chosen by them owes remuneration to the performers who participated in a performance contained in the audio-visual work.

[2]No remuneration is owed if:


|    the performers or their heirs personally exploit the exclusive right; or   
|    the audio-visual work is one of the following:   
|    company profile films, industrial films, advertising or promotional films, computer games, music videos, concert recordings, services or commissioned works by broadcasting organisations or other works in the field of journalism that are created under an employment contract or that are commissioned,   
|    archived works of broadcasting organisations (Art. 22*a*),   
|    orphan works (Art. 22*b*). 



[3]The right to remuneration is inalienable and unwaivable and only the performers are entitled to claim it; it substitutes any remuneration for the contractually agreed use of the performance. It may only be asserted by the approved collective rights management organisations.

[4]Performers only have a right to remuneration for their performances in an audio-visual work which was not produced by a person domiciled or with a registered office in Switzerland, if the country in which the audio-visual work was produced also provides for a collective right to remuneration for performers for making the work available.

[**Art. 36**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_36) [Rights of phonogram and audio-visual fixation producers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_36) 

A producer of phonograms and audio-visual fixations has the exclusive right:


|    a. to reproduce the fixations and to offer, transfer or otherwise distribute the reproductions;  
|    b. to make the fixations available through any kind of medium in such a way that persons may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. 

[**Art. 37**  Rights of broadcasting organisations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_37)

The provisions under Article 12 paragraph 1 and Article 13 as well as Chapters 4 and 5 of the Second Title of this Act apply mutatis mutandis to the rights to which the performers, phonogram and audio-visual fixation producers and broadcasting organisations are entitled.

[**Art. 39** Term of protection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_39) 

[1] Protection begins with the performance of the work or of the expression of folklore by the performers, with the publication of the phonogram or audio-visual fixation, or with its production if it is not published, it ends after 70 years. Protection of a broadcast begins with its transmission; it ends after 50 years or with the transmission of the broadcast; it ends after 50 years.

[1bis] The right to recognition as a performer under Article 33*a* paragraph1 expires on the death of the performer, but not before the term of protection under paragraph 1 expires.

[2] The term of protection is calculated from 31 December of the year in which the event determining the calculation occurred.

|    a. are the subject-matter of sales promotion, advertising or marketing with the goal of circumventing effective technological measures;  
|    b. have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than the circumvention of effective technological measures; or  
|    c. are primarily designed, manufactured, adapted or performed for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of effective technological measures.

[4] The ban on circumvention may not be enforced against those persons who undertake the circumvention exclusively for legally permitted uses.

[**Art. 39***b* Monitoring office for technological measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_39_b)

|    The provider has been notified of the infringement.   
|    The internet hosting service has created a particular risk of such infringements, specifically due to a technical mode of operation or an economic orientation which encourages infringement. 

[2]The provider must take the technical and economic measures reasonably expected of them, taking into account the risk of such infringements.

## [Chapter 2 Authorisation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#tit_4/chap_2)

[**Art. 41** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_41) 

Any person who exploits rights which are subject to federal supervision requires authorisation from the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property (IPI).

[**Art. 42** Requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_42) 

[1] Authorisation is only given to collective rights management organisations which:


|    a. have been founded under Swiss law, are domiciled in Switzerland and conduct their business from Switzerland;  
|    b. have the management of copyright or related rights as their primary purpose;  
|    c. are open to all holders of rights;  
|    d. grant an appropriate right of participation in the decisions of the society to authors and performers;  
|    e. guarantee compliance with the statutory provisions, in particular in terms of their articles of association;  
|    f. give rise to the expectation of the effective and economic exploitation of rights.

[2] In general, authorisation is only granted to a single collective rights management organisation per category of work and to a single collective rights management organisation for related rights.

[**Art. 43** Term; publication](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_43) 

[1] Authorisation is granted for five years; on expiry, it may be renewed for the same term.

[2] Notice of the granting, renewal, modification, withdrawal and non-renewal of such authorisation shall be published.

## [Chapter 2*a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#tit_4/chap_2_a) [Extended Collective Licences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#tit_4/chap_2_a)

[**Art. 43***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_43_a) 

[1]A collective rights management organisation may also assert the exclusive rights of rights holders who are not represented by it for the use of a large number of published works and protected performances, and for which assertion is not subject to the authorisation requirement under Article 41, insofar as the following requirements are fulfilled:


|    The licensed use does not impair the normal exploitation of protected works and performances.   
|    The collective rights management organisation represents a significant number of rights holders within the scope of the licence. 

[2]Works located in collections of public and publicly accessible libraries, archives or other memory institutions are considered to be published within the meaning of paragraph 1.

[3]The collective rights management organisations shall make the extended collective licences known in an appropriate manner before they come into force, in particular via publication in easily accessible and traceable locations.

[4]Rights holders and holders of an exclusive licence may request the collective rights management organisation which is granting an extended collective licence to exclude their rights from a particular collective licence; the applicability of this collective licence to the protected works or protected services in question ends with the receipt of the opt out notice.

[5]Neither the provisions regarding tariffs (Art. 46 and 47) nor the provisions regarding the supervision of tariffs (Art. 55–60) apply to extended collective licences; however, proceeds from these exploitations must be distributed in accordance with the principles of Article 49. Exploitation under this article is subject to the obligation to provide information and render account (Art. 50) and the supervision of the conduct of business (Art. 52–54).

## [Chapter 3 Obligations of the Collective Rights Management Organisations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#tit_4/chap_3)


[**Art. 44** Obligation to administer rights](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_44) 

The collective rights management organisations have an obligation to the holders of rights to assert those rights that fall within their field of activity.

[**Art. 45** Principles of the conduct of business](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_45) 

[1] The collective rights management organisations are required to conduct their business in accordance with proper business management principles.

[2] They administer the rights in accordance with set rules and with the principle of equal treatment.

[3] They may not aim to make a profit.

[4] They shall conclude, wherever possible, reciprocal agreements with foreign collective rights management organisations.

[**Art. 46**  Tariffs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_46) 

[1] The collective rights management organisations shall draw up tariffs for the remuneration that they collect.

[2] They negotiate the terms of each tariff with the relevant associations of users.

[3] They shall submit the tariffs to the Federal Arbitration Commission (Art. 55) for approval and shall publish the approved tariffs.

[**Art. 47** Joint tariff](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_47) 

[1] Where more than one collective rights management organisation operates in the same field of use, they shall draw up a joint tariff applying uniform principles for use of the same works or performances and shall designate one of their number as the joint office for payment.

[2] The Federal Council may enact further provisions concerning their collaboration.

[**Art. 48** Principles of distribution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_48) 

[1] The collective rights management organisations are required to draw up distribution regulations and to submit them to the IPI for approval.

[2] With the approval of the supreme organ of the rights management organisation, a portion of the proceeds may be used for social welfare purposes and for the appropriate promotion of culture.

[**Art. 49** Distribution of the proceeds](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_49) 

[1] The collective rights management organisations must distribute the exploitation proceeds in proportion to the revenue derived from the individual works and performances. They must make all reasonable efforts to identify those who are entitled to a share of the proceeds.

[2] If a distribution entails unreasonable expense, the collective rights management organisations may estimate the extent of revenue; the estimates are based on factors that are capable of verification and are appropriate.

[3] The proceeds are divided between the original holders of rights and other entitled persons in such a way that an equitable share goes to the author and the performer. A different distribution is permissible where the expense would be unreasonable.

[4] Contractual agreements made by the original holders of rights with third parties take precedence over the rules of distribution.

[**Art. 50** Obligation to provide information and render account](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_50) 

The collective rights management organisations must provide the IPI with all the information and documents necessary for carrying out its supervisory duties, and also provide account of its activities in an annual report.

## [Chapter 4 Obligation to Provide Information to Collective Rights Management Organisations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#tit_4/chap_4)


[**Art. 51**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_51) 

[1] Where it may reasonably be expected, the users of works must provide the collective rights management organisations with all the necessary information for the determination and application of the tariffs and for distributing the proceeds in a form that corresponds to the state of the art and allows for automatic data processing.

[1bis] Collective rights management organisations are entitled to exchange information received under this Article with one another, insofar as this is necessary for them to carry out their activities.

[2] The collective rights management organisations are obliged to preserve trade secrets.

[**Art. 55** Federal Arbitration Commission for the Exploitation of Copyrights and Related Rights](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_55) 

[1] The Federal Arbitration Commission for the Exploitation of Copyrights and Related Rights (Arbitration Commission) is responsible for approving the tariffs of the collective rights management organisations (Art. 46).

[2] Its members are appointed by the Federal Council. It regulates the organisation and procedures of the Arbitration Commission in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act of 20 December 1968.

[3] The Arbitration Commission accepts no directives in taking its decisions; the staff of the Secretariat of the Commission are answerable for such activity to the Chairman of the Commission.

[**Art. 56** Composition of the Arbitration Commission](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_56) 

[1] The Arbitration Commission consists of a chairman, two co-arbitrators, two deputies as well as additional arbitrators.

[2] The additional arbitrators are nominated by the collective rights management organisations and the relevant associations of users of works and performances.

[**Art. 57**  Quorum for taking decisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_57) 

[1]The Arbitration Commission takes its decisions with a quorum of five members: the chairman, two co-arbitrators and two additional arbitrators.

[2]The chairman designates the two additional arbitrators for each item of business, who must be competent in the matter at hand. One of the additional arbitrators is designated on a nomination by the collective rights management organisations and one on a nomination by the users’ associations.

[3] The fact that a technically competent member belongs to a collective rights management organisation or to a users’ association does not in itself constitute grounds for his recusal.

[**Art. 58** Administrative supervision](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_58) 

[1] The Federal Department of Justice and Police is the administrative supervisory authority for the Arbitration Commission.

[2] The Arbitration Commission shall submit an annual report to the Department on its activities.

[**Art. 59** Approval of the tariffs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_59) 

[1] The Arbitration Commission shall approve the tariff submitted to it if its structure and individual provisions are fair and reasonable.

[2] It may make modifications after hearing the collective rights management organisation and the users’ associations (Art. 46 para. 2) involved in the procedure.

[3] Finally approved tariffs are binding on the courts.

[**Art. 60** Principle of equitableness](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1798_1798_1798/en#art_60) 

[1] When determining remuneration, account is taken of:


|    a. the proceeds obtained from the use of the work, performance, phonogram or audio-visual fixation or broadcast, or alternatively the costs incurred in such use;  
|    b. the nature and quantity of the works, performances, phonograms or audio-visual fixations or broadcasts used;  
|    c. the ratio of protected to unprotected works, performances, phonograms or audio-visual fixations or broadcasts as well as to other services.

[2] Remuneration normally amounts to a maximum of ten per cent of the proceeds or costs incurred from the use of the copyright and a maximum of three per cent for related rights; however, it is determined in such a way that entitled persons receive equitable remuneration conditioned upon sound financial management for the administration of rights.

[3] The use of the work under Article 19 paragraph 1 letter b is subject to preferential tariffs.

[4] The rental of copies of works in accordance with Article 13 by public or publicly accessible libraries is subject to preferential tariffs in order to safeguard the institution’s mandate to disseminate knowledge.
