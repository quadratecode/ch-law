# Federal Acton Cartels and other Restraints of Competition

## (Cartel Act, CartA)

of 6 October 1995 (Status as of 1 January 2022)

The Federal Assembly of the Swiss Confederation

based on Articles 27 paragraph 1, 96, 97 paragraph 2 and 122 of the   
Federal Constitution,  
in implementation of the competition law provisions contained in international agreements,   
and having considered the Federal Council Dispatch of 23 November 1994,

decrees:

# [Chapter 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#chap_1)

[**Art. 1** Purpose](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_1) 

The purpose of this Act is to prevent the harmful economic or social effects of cartels and other restraints of competition and, by doing so, to promote competition in the interests of a liberal market economy.

[**Art. 2** Scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_2) 

1 This Act applies to private or public undertakings that are parties to cartels or to other agreements affecting competition, which exercise market power or which participate in concentrations of undertakings.

[1bis] Undertakings are all consumers or suppliers of goods or services active in commerce regardless of their legal or organisational form.

2 This Act applies to practices that have an effect in Switzerland, even if they originate in another country.

[**Art. 3** Relationship to other statutory provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_3) 

1 Statutory provisions that do not allow for competition in a market for certain goods or services take precedence over the provisions of this Act. Such statutory provisions include in particular:


|    a. provisions that establish an official market or price system; and  
|    b. provisions that grant special rights to specific undertakings to enable them to fulfil public duties. 

2 This Act does not apply to effects on competition that result exclusively from the legislation governing intellectual property. However, import restrictions based on intellectual property rights shall be assessed under this Act.

3 The procedures to assess restraints of competition under this Act shall take precedence over procedures under the Price Supervision Act of 20 December 1985 unless the Competition Commission and the Price Supervisor jointly decide otherwise.

[**Art. 4** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_4) 

1 Agreements affecting competition are binding or non-binding agreements and concerted practices between undertakings operating at the same or at different levels of production which have a restraint of competition as their object or effect.

2 Dominant undertakings are one or more undertakings in a specific market that are able, as suppliers or consumers, to behave to an appreciable extent independently of the other participants (competitors, suppliers or consumers) in the market.

[2bis] An undertaking with relative market power is an undertaking on which other undertakings are dependent for the supply of or demand for goods or services in such a way that there are no adequate and reasonable opportunities for switching to other undertakings.

3 Concentration of undertakings are:


|    a. the merger of two or more previously independent undertakings;  
|    b. any transaction, in particular the acquisition of an equity interest or the conclusion of an agreement, by which one or more undertakings acquire direct or indirect control of one or more previously independent undertakings or parts thereof.

# [Chapter 2 Substantive Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#chap_2)

## [Section 1 Unlawful Restraints of Competition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#chap_2/sec_1)

[**Art. 5** Unlawful agreements affecting competition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_5) 

1 Agreements that significantly restrict competition in a market for specific goods or services and are not justified on grounds of economic efficiency, and all agreements that eliminate effective competition are unlawful.

2 Agreements affecting competition are deemed to be justified on grounds of economic efficiency if:


|    a. they are necessary in order to reduce production or distribution costs, improve products or production processes, promote research into or dissemination of technical or professional know-how, or exploit resources more rationally; and  
|    b. they will under no circumstances enable the parties involved to eliminate effective competition.

3 The following agreements between actual or potential competitors are presumed to lead to the elimination of effective competition:


|    a. agreements to directly or indirectly fix prices;  
|    b. agreements to limit the quantities of goods or services to be produced, purchased or supplied;   
|    c. agreements to allocate markets geographically or according to trading partners.

4 The elimination of effective competition is also presumed in the case of agreements between undertakings at different levels of the production and distribution chain regarding fixed or minimum prices, and in the case of agreements contained in distribution contracts regarding the allocation of territories to the extent that sales by other distributors into these territories are not permitted.

[**Art. 6** Categories of agreements affecting competition that are deemed justified](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_6) 

1 The conditions under which agreements affecting competition are as a general rule deemed justified on grounds of economic efficiency may be set out in ordinances or general notices. In doing so the following agreements will be taken into consideration in particular:


|    a. co-operation agreements relating to research and development;  
|    b. specialisation and rationalisation agreements, including agreements concerning the use of tools for calculating costs;  
|    c. agreements granting exclusive rights to purchase or sell certain goods or services;  
|    d. agreements granting exclusive licences for intellectual property rights;  
|    e. agreements that have the purpose of improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized undertakings, provided their effect on the market is limited.

2 Such ordinances and general notices may also recognise particular forms of co-operation specific to certain sectors of the economy as being generally justified, in particular agreements concerning the effective implementation of public law provisions on the protection of customers or investors in the field of financial services.

3 General notices are published by the Competition Commission in the Federal Gazette. Ordinances within the meaning of paragraphs. 1 and 2 above shall be issued by the Federal Council.

[**Art. 7** Unlawful practices by dominant undertakings and undertakings with relative market power](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_7)

1 Dominant undertakings and undertakings with relative market power behave unlawfully if, by abusing their position in the market, they hinder other undertakings from starting or continuing to compete, or disadvantage trading partners. 

2 The following behaviour is in particular considered unlawful:


|    a. any refusal to deal (e.g. refusal to supply or to purchase goods);  
|    b. any discrimination between trading partners in relation to prices or other conditions of trade;  
|    c. any imposition of unfair prices or other unfair conditions of trade;  
|    d. any under-cutting of prices or other conditions directed against a specific competitor;  
|    e. any limitation of production, supply or technical development;  
|    f. any conclusion of contracts on the condition that the other contracting party agrees to accept or deliver additional goods or services;  
|    g. the restriction of the opportunity for buyers to purchase goods or services offered both in Switzerland and abroad at the market prices and conditions customary in the industry in the foreign country concerned.

[**Art. 8** Exceptional authorisation for compelling public interest reasons](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_8) 

Agreements affecting competition and behaviour by dominant undertakings that have been declared unlawful by the competent authority may be authorised by the Federal Council at the request of the undertakings involved if, in exceptional cases, they are necessary for compelling public interest reasons.

## [Section 2 Concentrations of Undertakings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#chap_2/sec_2)

[**Art. 9** Notification of planned concentrations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_9) 

1 Planned concentrations of undertakings must be notified to the Competition Commission before their implementation if in the financial year preceding the concentration:


|    a. the undertakings concerned together reported a turnover of at least 2 billion Swiss francs, or a turnover in Switzerland of at least 500 million Swiss francs, and  
|    b. at least two of the undertakings concerned each reported a turnover in Switzerland of at least 100 million Swiss francs.

2 …

3 In the case of insurance companies, «turnover» is replaced by «annual gross insurance premium income», and in the case of banks and other financial intermediaries that are subject to the accounting regulations set out in the Banking Act of 8 November 1934 by «gross income». 

4 Notwithstanding anything set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 above, notification is mandatory if one of the undertakings concerned has in proceedings under this Act in a final and non-appealable decision been held to be dominant in a market in Switzerland, and if the concentration concerns either that market or an adjacent market or a market upstream or downstream thereof.

5 The Federal Assembly may by general federal decree not subject to a referendum:


|    a. adjust the amounts set forth in paragraphs 1 to 3 above, taking account of any change in circumstances;  
|    b. establish special criteria for the notification of concentrations in certain sectors of the economy.

[**Art. 10** Assessment of concentrations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_10) 

1 Concentrations that have to be notified shall be investigated by the Competition Commission if a preliminary assessment (Art. 32 para. 1) reveals that they create or strengthen a dominant position.

2 The Competition Commission may prohibit a concentration or authorise it subject to conditions and obligations if the investigation indicates that the concentration: 


|    a. creates or strengthens a dominant position liable to eliminate effective competition; and  
|    b. does not improve the conditions of competition in another market such that the harmful effects of the dominant position can be outweighed.

3 If a concentration of banks within the meaning of the Banking Act is deemed necessary by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) for reasons related to creditor protection, the interests of creditors may be given priority. In these cases, FINMA takes the place of the Competition Commission, which it shall invite to submit an opinion.

4 In assessing the effects of a concentration on the effectiveness of competition, the Competition Commission also takes account of any market developments and the position of the undertakings in relation to international competition.

[**Art. 11** Exceptional authorisation for compelling public reasons](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_11) 

A concentration of undertakings that has been prohibited in accordance with Article 10 may be authorised by the Federal Council at the request of the undertakings involved if, in exceptional cases, it is necessary for compelling public interest reasons.

# [Chapter 3 Civil Procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#chap_3)

[**Art. 12** Rights arising from a hindrance of competition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_12) 

1 A person hindered by an unlawful restraint of competition from entering or competing in a market is entitled to request:


|    a. the elimination of or desistance from the hindrance;  
|    b. damages and satisfaction in accordance with the Code of Obligations;  
|    c. surrender of unlawfully earned profits in accordance with the provisions on agency without authority.

2 Hindrances of competition include in particular the refusal to deal and discriminatory measures.

3 The rights set out in paragraph 1 above are also accorded to persons who are hindered by a lawful restraint of competition more than is necessary for the implementation of that restraint.

[**Art. 13** Enforcement of the right to elimination and desistance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_13) 

In order to enforce the right to elimination and desistance, the courts may, at the plaintiff's request, rule that:


|    a. any contracts are null and void in whole or in part;  
|    b. the person responsible for the hindrance of competition must conclude contracts with the person so hindered on terms that are in line with the market or the industry standard.

[**Art. 14**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_14)

[**Art. 15** Assessment of the legality of a restraint of competition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_15) 

1 If the legality of a restraint of competition is questioned in the course of civil proceedings, the case shall be referred to the Competition Commission for an expert report.

2 If a restraint of competition that is as such unlawful is claimed to be necessary for compelling public interest reasons, the matter shall be decided by the Federal Council.

[**Art. 16** and **17**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_16)

1 Members of the Competition Commission must recuse themselves if there are grounds for recusal under Article 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act of 20 December 1968.

2 As a general rule, the fact that a member of the Commission represents an umbrella organisation does not constitute a personal interest or any other ground for recusal.

3 If recusal is disputed, the Competition Commission or the relevant chamber shall decide in the absence of the member concerned.

[**Art. 23** Duties of the Secretariat](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_23)

2 The notice states the purpose of and the parties to the investigation. It further contains an invitation to third parties to come forward within 30 days if they wish to participate in the investigation.

3 Failure to give notice does not prevent any investigative measures.

[**Art. 29** Amicable settlement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_29) 

1 If the Secretariat considers that a restraint of competition is unlawful, it may propose an amicable settlement to the undertakings involved concerning ways to eliminate the restraint.

2 The amicable settlement is formulated in writing and approved by the Competition Commission.

[**Art. 30** Decision](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_30)

If such an application is submitted, the period in which an appeal may be filed with the Federal Administrative Court begins to run only after notification of the parties of the Federal Council's decision.

2 Applications for exceptional authorisation by the Federal Council may also be submitted within 30 days of the entry into effect of a judgment of the Federal Administrative Court or the Federal Supreme Court.

3 The authorisation is of limited duration and may be subject to conditions and obligations.

4 The Federal Council may on request extend an authorisation if the conditions for granting it continue to be met.

## [Section 3 Review of Concentrations of Undertakings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#chap_4/sec_3)

[**Art. 32** Opening an investigation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_32) 

1 On receiving a notification of a planned concentration of undertakings (Art. 9), the Competition Commission decides if there are grounds for conducting an investigation. The Competition Commission notifies the undertakings concerned of the opening of an investigation within one month of receiving the notification. If no such notice is given within that time period, the concentration may be implemented without reservation.

2 The undertakings concerned must refrain from implementing the concentration for one month following the notification unless the Competition Commission has at their request authorised them to do so for good cause.

[**Art. 33** Investigation procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_33) 

1 If the Competition Commission decides to conduct an investigation, the Secretariat publishes the principal terms of the notification of the concentration and states the time frame within which third parties may comment on the notified concentration.

2 At the outset of the investigation the Competition Commission decides whether the concentration may exceptionally be implemented provisionally or whether it should remain suspended. 

3 The Competition Commission shall complete its investigation within four months unless prevented from doing so for reasons attributable to the undertakings concerned.

[**Art. 34** Legal effect](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_34) 

The legal effect of a concentration that has to be notified is suspended, subject to the expiry of the deadline set out in Article 32 paragraph 1 and any provisional authorisation to implement the concentration. If the Competition Commission does not take a decision before the expiry of the deadline set out in Article 33 paragraph 3, the concentration is deemed authorised, unless the Competition Commission asserts by way of ruling that it has been prevented from conducting the investigation for reasons attributable to the undertakings concerned.

[**Art. 35** Failure to comply with the notification requirement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_35) 

If a concentration that should have been notified has been implemented without due notification, the procedure set out in Articles 32 to 38 is initiated ex officio. In this case, the time period set out in Article 32 paragraph 1 begins to run as soon as the authority possesses all the information that would have to be provided in a notification of a concentration.

[**Art. 36** Exceptional authorisation procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_36) 

1 If the Competition Commission has prohibited a concentration, the undertakings concerned may, within 30 days, submit to the EAER an application for exceptional authorisation by the Federal Council for compelling public interest reasons. If such an application is submitted, the period in which an appeal may be filed with the Federal Administrative Court begins to run only after the parties have been notified of the Federal Council's decision.

2 Applications for exceptional authorisation by the Federal Council may also be submitted within 30 days of the entry into effect of a judgment of the Federal Administrative Court or the Federal Supreme Court.

3 If possible, the Federal Council takes its decision within four months of receipt of the application.

[**Art. 37** Restoration of effective competition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_37) 

1 If a prohibited concentration has been implemented or if a concentration is prohibited after its implementation and exceptional authorisation for the concentration has not been requested or granted, the undertakings concerned are required to take the necessary steps to restore effective competition.

2 The Competition Commission may require the undertakings concerned to make binding proposals as to how effective competition may be restored. It shall set them a deadline within which to do so.

3 If the Competition Commission accepts the proposed measures, it may decide how and by when the undertakings concerned must implement them.

4 If the undertakings concerned do not make any proposals despite being required to do so by the Competition Commission, or if the proposals are not accepted by the Competition Commission, the Competition Commission may order the following measures by way of a ruling:


|    a. the separation of any combined undertakings or assets;  
|    b. the cessation of the controlling influence;  
|    c. other measures to restore effective competition.

[**Art. 38** Revocation and revision](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_38) 

1 The Competition Commission may revoke an authorisation or decide to investigate a concentration despite the expiry of the deadline set out in Article 32 paragraph 1 if:


|    a. the undertakings concerned have provided inaccurate information;  
|    b. the authorisation was obtained fraudulently; or  
|    c. the undertakings concerned are in serious breach of a condition attached to the authorisation.

2 The Federal Council may revoke an exceptional authorisation on the same grounds.

## [Section 4 Procedure and Rights of Appeal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#chap_4/sec_4)

[**Art. 39** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_39) 

The Administrative Procedure Act of 20 December 1968 applies to all procedures under this Act unless this Act stipulates otherwise. 

[**Art. 40** Duty to provide information](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_40) 

Parties to agreements, undertakings with market power, undertakings concerned in concentrations and affected third parties shall provide the competition authorities with all the information required for their investigations and produce the necessary documents. The right to refuse to provide information is governed by Articles 16 and 17of the Administrative Procedure Act of 20 December 1968.

[**Art. 41** Administrative assistance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_41) 

Federal and cantonal government offices are required to co-operate with the competition authorities in their enquiries and to make any necessary documents available to them.

[**Art. 42**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_42) [Investigative measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_42) 

1 The competition authorities may hear third parties as witnesses and require the parties to an investigation to give evidence. Article 64 of the Federal Act of 4 December 1947 on Federal Civil Procedure applies by analogy.

2 The competition authorities may order searches and seize any evidence. Articles 45–50 of the Federal Act of 22 March 1974 on Administrative Criminal Law apply by analogy to these coercive measures. Searches and seizures are ordered by a member of the presiding body in response to a motion from the Secretariat.

[**Art. 42***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_42_a) [Investigations in proceedings under the Swiss/EC Air Transport Agreement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_42_a) 

1 The Competition Commission is the Swiss authority responsible for co-operation with the institutions of the European Community under Article 11 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation of 21 June 1999 on Air Transport.

2 If an undertaking opposes a review in proceedings under Article 11 of the Agreement, investigative measures pursuant to Article 42 may be undertaken at the request of the European Commission. Article 44 applies.

1 Data may only be disclosed to a foreign competition authority based on an act, an international agreement or with the consent of the undertaking concerned.

2 Without the consent of the undertaking concerned, the competition authorities may disclose confidential data, in particular business secrets, to a foreign competition authority on the basis of an international agreement only if:


|    a. the behaviour under investigation in the recipient state is also unlawful under Swiss law;   
|    b. both competition authorities are investigating the same or related behaviour or transactions;   
|    c. foreign competition authority uses the data only for the purpose of applyingprovisions of competition law or as evidence in relation to the subject matter of the investigation for which the competition authority requested the information;   
|    d. the data is not used in criminal or civil proceedings;  
|    e. the foreign procedural law safeguards party rights and official secrecy; and  
|    f. the confidential data is not disclosed to the foreign competition authority in the context of an amicable settlement (Art. 29) or when assisting in the discovery and elimination of the restraint of competition (Art. 49*a*para. 2).

3 The competition authorities shall notify the undertaking concerned and invite it to state its views before transmitting the data to the foreign competition authority.

[**Art. 43** Participation of third parties in the investigation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1996/546_546_546/en#art_43)

|    a. persons who as a result of a restraint of competition are hindered from starting or continuing to compete;  
|    b. professional or trade associations whose bylaws authorise them to safeguard their members' economic interests, provided members of the association or of one of its sections may also take part in the investigation;  
|    c. organisations of national or regional importance whose work is dedicated to consumer protection under the terms of their bylaws.

2 The Secretariat may require in a procedure that groups of more than five participants who have identical interests appoint a common representative if otherwise the investigation would be unduly complicated. It may in any event limit participation to a hearing only; the rights of parties under the Administrative Procedure Act of 20 December 1968 are reserved.

3 Paragraphs 1 and 2 above apply by analogy to the procedure for granting an exceptional authorisation for an unlawful restraint of competition by the Federal Council (Art. 8).

4 In proceedings for the review of concentrations of undertakings, only the undertakings concerned have the rights of parties.
