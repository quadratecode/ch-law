### [A. Patentable inventions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A)

#### [I. Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I)

[**Art. 1**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_1) 

[1] Patents for inventions are granted for new inventions applicable in industry.

[2] Anything that is obvious having regard to the state of the art (Art. 7 para. 2) is not patentable as an invention.

[3] Patents are granted without the guarantee of the State.

#### [II. The human body and its elements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 1***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_1_a)

[1] The human body as such, at all stages of its formation and development, including the embryo, is not patentable.

[2] Elements of the human body in their natural environment are not patentable. An element of the human body is, however, patentable as an invention if it is produced by means of a technical process, a beneficial technical effect is indicated and the further requirements of Article 1 are fulfilled; Article 2 remains reserved.

#### [III. Gene sequences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 1***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_1_b)

[1] A naturally occurring sequence or partial sequence of a gene is not patentable as such.

[2] Sequences that are derived from a naturally occurring sequence or partial sequence of a gene may, however, be patented as an invention if they are produced by means of a technical process, their function is specifically indicated, and the further requirements of Article 1 are fulfilled; Article 2 remains reserved.

### [B. Exclusion from patentability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_1/lvl_B)

[**Art. 2**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_2)

[1] Inventions whose exploitation is contrary to human dignity or that disregard the integrity of living organisms or that are in any other way contrary to public policy or morality are not patentable. In particular, no patent may be granted for:


|    a. processes for cloning human beings and the clones obtained thereby;  
|    b. processes for forming hybrid organisms by using human germ cells, human totipotent cells or human embryonic stem cells and the entities obtained thereby;  
|    c. processes of parthenogenesis by using human germinal material and the parthenogenetic entities obtained thereby;  
|    d. processes for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings and the germ line cells obtained thereby;  
|    e. unmodified human embryonic stem cells and stem cell lines;  
|    f. the use of human embryos for non-medical purposes;  
|    g. processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering without being justified by overriding interests worthy of protection, and also animals resulting from such processes.

[2] Also excluded from patentability are:


|    a. methods for treatment by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body;  
|    b. plant varieties and animal varieties or essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals; however, subject to the reservation of paragraph 1, microbiological or other technical processes and the products obtained thereby as well as inventions that concern plants or animals are patentable provided that their application is not technically confined to a single plant or animal variety.

### [C. Right to the grant of a patent](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_1/lvl_C)

#### [I. Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I)

[**Art. 3**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_3) 

[1] The inventor, his successor in title, or a third party owning the invention under any other title has the right to the grant of the patent.

[2] Where several inventors have made an invention jointly, they have this right jointly.

[3] Where two or more inventors have made the invention independently of each other, the person who makes the earlier application or whose application has the earliest priority date has this right.

#### [II. In the examination procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 4**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_4)

1 The patent applicant must provide the IPI with written confirmation of the name of the inventor.

[2] The person named by the patent applicant shall be mentioned as the inventor in the Patent Register, in the publication of the patent application and in the grant of the patent, as well as in the patent specification.

[3] Paragraph 2 applies by analogy if a third party produces an enforceable judgment establishing that he and not the person named by the patent applicant is the inventor.

#### [II. Waiver of mention](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_1/lvl_D/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 6**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_6) 

1 If the inventor named by the patent applicant waives his right to the measures provided for in Article 5 paragraph 2, these measures shall not be taken.

[**Art. 16**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_16)

Patent applicants or proprietors who are Swiss nationals may rely on the provisions of the binding text for Switzerland of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 20 March 1883, where those provisions are more favourable than the provisions of this Act.

## [Section 2 Right of Priority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_2)

### [A. Conditions and effects of priority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_2/lvl_A)

[**Art. 17**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_17) 

[1] Where an invention is the subject of a regular filing of an application for a patent for an invention, a utility model or an inventor's certificate, and where the filing takes place in or with effect in a country that is a party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 20 March 1883 or the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization of 15 April 1994, (Appendix 1C, Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights), it shall give rise to a right of priority in accordance with Article 4 of the Paris Convention. This right may be claimed for a patent application filed in Switzerland for the same invention within 12 months from the date of the first filing.

[1bis] The first filing in a country that grants reciprocity to Switzerland has the same effect as the first filing in a country that is party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.

[1ter] Except as otherwise provided by this Act or by the Ordinance, paragraph 1 above and Article 4 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 20 March 1883 apply by analogy to a first filing in Switzerland.

[2] The effect of the priority right is that the application may not be prejudiced by any circumstances that have arisen since the date of the first filing.

[3] …

### [B. Entitlement to claim the right of priority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_2/lvl_B)

[**Art. 18**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_18) 

[1] …

[2] The right of priority may be claimed by the first applicant or the person who has acquired the right belonging to the first applicant to file a patent application in Switzerland for the same invention.

[3] If the first filing, the filing in Switzerland or both were effected by a person who was not entitled to the grant of the patent, the entitled person may claim the priority deriving from that first filing.

### [C. Formal requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_2/lvl_C)

[**Art. 19**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_19)

[1] Any person claiming a right of priority must file a declaration of priority and a priority document with the IPI.

[2] The right of priority is forfeited if the time limits and formal requirements laid down by the Ordinance are not complied with.

### [D. Burden of proof in legal proceedings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_2/lvl_D)

[**Art. 20**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_20) 

[1] Acceptance of a priority claim in the procedure for the grant of the patent does not relieve the proprietor of the patent of the obligation to prove the existence of such right in the case of legal proceedings.

[2] The filing on the basis of which priority is claimed is presumed to be the first filing (Article 17 para. 1 and 1bis). 

### [E. Prohibition of double patenting](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_2/lvl_E)

[1] The proprietor of the patent may partially surrender the patent by requesting the IPI to:


|    a. revoke a patent claim (Art. 51 and 55); or  
|    b. limit an independent claim by combining one or more patent claims, which are dependent on it; or  
|    c. limit an independent claim in some other way; in such cases, the limited claim must refer to the same invention and define an embodiment that is included in the specification of the published patent and in the version of the patent application that determined the date of filing.

[2] …

#### [II. Issue of new patents](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

|    b. the invention is not described in the patent specification in a manner sufficiently clear and precise for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art;  
|    c. the subject-matter of the patent goes beyond the content of the patent application in the version that determined the filing date;  
|    d. the proprietor of the patent is neither the inventor nor his successor in title, nor has a right to the grant of the patent on other legal grounds.

[2] Where a patent is granted with recognition of priority, and the application claiming the priority does not lead to a patent, the court may require the proprietor of the patent to state the grounds and to present evidence; if the information is withheld, the court has full discretion in its judgment of this.

#### [II. Partial nullity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

[2] …

[3] If an assignment is ordered, licences or other rights granted to third parties in the intervening period lapse; however, if they have used the invention commercially in Switzerland in good faith or have made special preparations to do so, these third parties are entitled to be granted a non-exclusive licence.

[4] Any claims for damages are reserved.

[5] Article 40*e* applies by analogy.

[2] Where the said rights are owned by two or more persons, each entitled person may exercise the rights only with the consent of the others; however, each one may independently dispose of his part or bring an action for infringement of the patent. 

[2bis] The transfer of a patent application and of the patent by legal act is valid only if evidenced in writing. 

[3] A patent may be transferred without the transfer being recorded in the Patent Register; however, until an entry is made, any action provided for in this Act may be taken against the former proprietor of the patent. 

[4] Rights of third parties not recorded in the Patent Register are invalid against persons who have acquired the rights to the patent in good faith.

[1] Three years from the date of the grant of the patent, or at the earliest four years after filing the patent application, any person with a legitimate interest may apply to the court for the grant of a non-exclusive licence to use the invention if the proprietor of the patent has not sufficiently exploited it in Switzerland by the time of the action and cannot justify such a failure. Importing is also considered domestic exploitation.

[2] …

[3] At the request of the plaintiff, the court may grant a licence immediately after the action has been filed without prejudice to the final judgment providing that, in addition to the conditions set out in paragraph 1, the plaintiff provides *prima facie* evidence that he has an interest in the immediate use of the invention and that he provides adequate security to the defendant; the defendant shall be given the opportunity to be heard beforehand.

#### [II. Action for cancellation of the patent](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_5/lvl_C/lvl_I_I)

[1] If the grant of licences does not suffice to meet the demand of the domestic market, any person with a proven interest may bring an action for the cancellation of the patent after a period of two years from the grant of the first licence under Article 37 paragraph 1.

[2] If the legislation of the country of which the proprietor of the patent is a national or in which he is resident allows an action for cancellation of the patent for failure to exploit the invention in that country as early as three years after the grant of the patent, such an action shall be allowed instead of the action for the grant of a licence, subject to the conditions specified in Article 37 for the grant of licences.

#### [III. Exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_5/lvl_C/lvl_II_I)

[1] Any person may bring an action before the court to be granted a non-exclusive licence for the manufacture of patent-protected pharmaceutical products and for their export to a country that has insufficient or no production capacity of its own in the pharmaceutical sector and which requires these products to combat public health problems, in particular those related to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics (beneficiary country).

[2] Countries that have declared in the World Trade Organization (WTO) that they wholly or partly renounce their claim to a licence in accordance with paragraph 1 are excluded from being beneficiary countries in accordance with the terms of their declaration. All other countries that fulfil the requirements of paragraph 1 may be beneficiary countries.

[3] The licence in accordance with paragraph 1 is limited to the production of the pharmaceutical product in the quantity that meets the requirements of the beneficiary country; the total quantity must be exported to the beneficiary country.

[4] The owner of the licence in accordance with paragraph 1, as well as any manufacturer that produces products under licence, must ensure that they are clearly identified as products that have been produced under a licence in accordance with paragraph 1, and that the products are distinguished by their packaging or by their special colouring or shape from patent-protected products, provided this does not have a significant impact on the price of the products in the beneficiary country.

[5] The Federal Council shall regulate the requirements for the grant of licences in accordance with paragraph 1. In particular, it shall stipulate the information or notifications the responsible court must possess in order to be able to decide on the grant of the licence in accordance with paragraph 1, and shall regulate the measures in accordance with paragraph 4.

### [I. Common provisions for Articles 36–40*d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_1/chap_5/lvl_I)

[**Art. 40***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#art_40_e)

[1] The licences provided for in Articles 36–40*d* are granted only if efforts by the applicant to obtain a contractual licence on appropriate market terms within a reasonable period of time have been unsuccessful; in the case of a licence in accordance with Article 40*d*, a period of 30 working days is regarded as reasonable. Such efforts are not required in situations of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use.

[2] The scope and term of the licence are limited to the purpose for which it has been granted.

[3] The licence may only be transferred with that part of the enterprise which uses the licence. This also applies to sub-licences.

[4] The licence is primarily granted for supplying the domestic market. Article 40*d* remains reserved.

[5] The proprietor of the patent has the right to appropriate remuneration. In assessing the remuneration, the circumstances of the individual case and the economic value of the licence are taken into account. In the case of a licence under Article 40*d*, the remuneration is determined by taking into account the economic value of the licence in the importing country, its level of development and the urgency in public health and humanitarian terms. The Federal Council shall specify the method of calculation.

[6] The court shall decide on the grant and revocation of licences, on their scope and duration as well as on the remuneration payable. In particular, it shall revoke an entitled person’s licence on request if the circumstances that led to its being granted no longer apply and it is not expected that they will arise again. Appropriate protection of the legal interests of the entitled person remains reserved. Where a licence is granted under Article 40*d*, legal remedies have no suspensive effect.

[2] He must file the request within two months of receiving notice from the IPI of failure to observe the time limit, and six months at the latest from the expiry of the said time limit. He must also carry out in full, within these time limits, the omitted act, supplement where necessary the patent application and pay the fee for further processing.

[3] Acceptance of the request for further processing has the effect of restoring the situation that would have resulted from carrying out the act in good time. Article 48 remains reserved.

[4] Further processing is ruled out in the case of failure to observe:


|    a. time limits that do not have to be observed vis-à-vis the IPI;  
|    b. time limits for filing a request for further processing (para. 2);  
|    c. time limits for filing a request for re-establishment of rights (Art. 47 para. 2);

[1] Where the patent applicant or proprietor of the patent provides *prima facie* evidence of having been prevented, through no fault on his part, from observing a time limit prescribed by this Act or the Implementing Ordinance or one set by the IPI, he shall be granted, on request, the re-establishment of his rights. 

[2] The request shall be filed with the authority for which the act should have been carried out within two months of the removal of the cause of non-compliance with the time limit, and at the latest within one year of expiry of the unobserved time limit; at the same time, the omitted act must be carried out.

[1] The certificate takes effect on expiry of the maximum term of the patent for a period equal to the period which elapses between the date of filing under Article 56 and the date of the first authorisation of the medicinal product containing the product in Switzerland, minus five years.

[2] It is valid for no more than five years.

[3] The Federal Council may specify that the authorisation of a medicinal product containing the product granted in the European Economic Area (EEA) constitutes the first authorisation within the meaning of paragraph 1 if it is granted earlier than the first authorisation in Switzerland.

### [F. Time limit for filing the application](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_7/chap_1/lvl_F)

[2] If all authorisations are suspended, the certificate is also suspended. Suspension does not interrupt the term of the certificate.

[3] The Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products shall notify the IPI of any withdrawal or suspension of the authorisations.

### [K. Nullity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_7/chap_1/lvl_K)

|    b. the patent lapses before its maximum term expires (Article 15);  
|    c. the patent is declared null and void;  
|    d. the patent is limited to the extent that the product for which the certificate was granted is no longer covered by the claims;  
|    e. after the lapse of the patent, grounds exist which would have justified the declaration of nullity of the patent under letter c or a limitation under letter d.

[2] Any person may bring an action to have the certificate declared null and void before the authority responsible for declaring the nullity of the patent.

### [L. Procedure, Register, publications](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1955/871_893_899/en#tit_7/chap_1/lvl_L)
