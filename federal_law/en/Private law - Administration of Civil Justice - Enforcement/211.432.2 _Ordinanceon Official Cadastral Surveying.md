# [Chapter 1: General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#chap_1)

[**Art. 1**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_1) [Definition and purpose](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_1) 

[1] Official cadastral surveying as defined in Article 950 of the Swiss Civil Code consists of the surveying work approved by the canton and by the Confederation for the establishment and maintenance of the land register.

[2] The data of official cadastral surveying is geospatial reference data that is used by the federal authorities, the cantons and the communes, as well as industry and commerce, academic and scientific institutions and the general public to obtain geographical information.

[**Art. 1***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_1_a) [Relationship to general geoinformation law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_1_a) 

Official cadastral surveying is governed by the Geoinformation Ordinance of 21 May 2008, unless there are special provisions in this present Ordinance.

[**Art. 2**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_2)

[**Art. 3**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_3) [Planning and implementation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_3) 

[1] The Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS) defines the strategic planning of official cadastral surveying in consultation with the responsible cantonal authorities. 

[2] The cantons prepare implementation plans, which serve as the basis for the conclusion of programme agreements in accordance with Article 31 paragraph 2 GeoIG.

[3] In case of land reallotments and in areas in which necessary agricultural or forestry reallotments cannot be carried out in the foreseeable future, the technical work of data acquisition for the "landownership" information layer is performed using a simplified procedure. The DDPS specifies the technical requirements. 

[**Art. 4** Military installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_4) 

Provisions concerning the surveying of military installations that deviate from those in this Ordinance are reserved. 

# [Chapter 2: Content of Official Cadastral Surveying](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#chap_2)

[**Art. 5**  Elements of official cadastral surveying](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_5) 

Official cadastral surveying consists of:


|    a. the markers of the control points and boundary points;  
|    b. the data in accordance with the data model of official cadastral surveying;  
|    c. the cadastral map and further extracts of the cadastral data set required for the land registration;  
|    d. the required technical documents;  
|    e. the components and principles of former cadastral surveying under the old regulations;  
|    f. the base map of official cadastral surveying.

[**Art. 6**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_6) [Data model of official cadastral surveying](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_6) 

[1] The data model describes the content in accordance with the object catalogue, and the data structure in a standardised data description language. 

[2] The object catalogue comprises the following information layers: 


|    a. control points;  
|    b. land cover;  
|    c. single objects;  
|    d. heights;  
|    e. local names;   
|    f. landownership;   
|    g. pipelines;  
|    h. territorial boundaries;  
|    i. permanent landslip areas  
|    j. building addresses;  
|    k. administrative subdivisions.

[3] The "landownership” information layer includes properties in accordance with Article 655 paragraph 2 of the Swiss Civil Code insofar as these may be designated on an area basis, with the exception of parts in co-ownership.

[**Art. 6***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_6_a) [Responsibilities of the DDPS](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_6_a) 

[1] The DDPS defines the object catalogue and specifies the data to be captured, its accuracy and reliability, together with other requirements. Where necessary it may depart from Articles 3, 10 and 17 of the Geoinformation Ordinance of 21 May 2008.

[2] The DDPS specifies the official cadastral surveying interface.

[3] The DDPS specifies the content, updating and management of the extracts to be prepared from official cadastral surveying data, and also the related technical documentation.

[**Art. 6**[bis]](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_6_bis)

[**Art. 7**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_7) [Land Registry Plan](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_7) 

[1] The Land Registry Plan is a hard copy or a digital graphical extract from the data of official cadastral surveying, which, as a constituent part of the land register, delimits properties, area-related distinct and permanent rights and mineral rights determined on an area basis. It has the legal force of entries in the land register.

[2] The Land Registry Plan includes the content of the “control points”, “land cover”, “single objects”, “local names”, “landownership”, “pipelines”, "territorial boundaries", "building addresses" and “administrative subdivisions” information layers. 

[3] The cantons may, in addition to the cadastral surveying data, require boundaries of easements and servitudes to be portrayed, insofar as their positions are clearly defined on the ground.

[4] The Federal Directorate of Cadastral Surveying (FDCS)defines the cartographic specification of the Land Registry Plan.

[**Art. 8–9**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_8__9_)

[**Art. 10**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_10) [Cantonal Additions to the Federal Data Model](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_10) 

Within the framework laid down by the DDPS, the cantons may extend the content of official cadastral surveying as prescribed under federal law, and may specify additional requirements.

# [Chapter 3: Demarcation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#chap_3)

## [Section 1: General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#chap_3/sec_1)

[**Art. 11** Definition and Scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_11) 

[1] Demarcation comprises the delimitation of boundaries and the emplacement of boundary markers (monumentation).

[2] Demarcation is required for territorial boundaries, property boundaries and boundaries of distinct and permanent rights over others’ land (easements)insofar as the latter can be clearly delimited by boundary lines.

[**Art. 12** Cantonal law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_12) 

The cantons enact regulations dealing with demarcation within the framework of this Ordinance.

## [Section 2: Delimitation of Boundaries](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#chap_3/sec_2)

[**Art. 13** Procedures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_13) 

[1] In general, boundaries are to be defined *in situ*

[2] The cantons may specify that boundaries be defined on the basis of plans, aerial photographs or other suitable means:


|    a. in agricultural and forest land in mountainous and summer pasture areas as defined in the agricultural production register, and in unproductive areas;  
|    b. in the course of an updating process, subject to the agreement of the landowners concerned.

[**Art. 14**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_14) [Alignment of boundaries](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_14) 

[1] A valid boundary line between two adjacent boundary points may be a straight line or a circular arc.

[2] During first survey, renovation or updating of the "landownership” information layer, simplification of boundary lines should be sought. Existing boundary lines should be improved where possible.

[**Art. 14***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_14_a) [Elimination of discrepancies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_14_a) 

Discrepancies between maps of official cadastral surveying and reality, or between the plans themselves, shall be officially eliminated.

## [Section 3: Emplacement of Boundary Markers (Monumentation)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#chap_3/sec_3)

[**Art. 15** Basic principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_15) 

Boundary markers are to be emplaced so that boundaries will be permanently identifiable on the ground or can be found by simple means.

[**Art. 16** Timing](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_16) 

[1] Boundary markers should in general be emplaced before the initial capture of surveying data for the “landownership” information layer.

[2] Individual boundary markers may be emplaced after surveying in accordance with paragraph 1:


|    a. in the course of an updating process, if the boundary has not been delimited on the ground;  
|    b. if there are compelling reasons why it is not possible or desirable to carry out the work earlier.

[3] The boundary markers that are missing in accordance with paragraph 2 must be emplaced as soon as circumstances allow.

[**Art. 17** Exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_17) 

[1] If boundaries are defined by natural or artificial objects that are permanent and clearly identifiable, the requirement for monumentation is generally waived.

[2] The cantons may provide for further exceptions, in particular: 


|    a. in areas in which properties and area-related distinct and permanent rights (easements) are subject to reallotment (remembrement);  
|    b. for properties and for area-related distinct and permanent rights (easements), whose boundary markers are continually threatened by agricultural activity or other effects;  
|    c. in agricultural and forest land in mountainous and summer pasture areas as defined in the agricultural production register, and in unproductive areas.

[1] All data that is not subject to continuous updating will be updated periodically.

[2] Each periodic updating operation must extend over a large area forming a cohesive whole.

[3] The periodic update cycle should, if possible, correspond to that of the national topographic survey. It must not exceed twelve years.

[**Art. 25** Updating and the land register](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_25) 

[1] The Land Registrar may enter a subdivision or amalgamation of properties or of area-related distinct and permanent rights (easements) in the land register only on presentation of the deed of mutation signed by the responsible registered surveyor.

[2] The cantons regulate the relations between official cadastral surveying and the Land Registry.

[3] The "landownership” information layer includes properties in accordance with Article 655 paragraph 2 of the Swiss Civil Code, provided that they can be designated on an area basis, with the exception of parts in co-ownership.

## [Section 3: Verification](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#chap_4/sec_3)

[1] After completion of the verification, the Federal Directorate of Cadastral Surveying determines whether the federal requirements have been fulfilled and specifies the documents to be submitted.

[2] The FDCS reports the results of its examination to the canton and guarantees the appropriate payment, subject to correction of any notified defects.

[3] All defects notified in the report must be corrected before the public inspection process.

[4] The preliminary examination may be omitted, subject to agreement between the Confederation and the canton.

[**Art. 28**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_28) [Public inspection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/2446_2446_2446/en#art_28) 

[1] After completion of an initial survey or a renovation of official cadastral surveying and the elimination of discrepancies in accordance with Article 14*a*, where the rights of landowners are affected, public inspection and objection procedures must be carried out.

[2] The public inspection process covers the Land Registry Plan of the area concerned and other extracts from the data of official cadastral surveying relating to the maintenance of the land register.

[3] The cantons regulate the procedures, subject to the following principles:


|    a. The public inspection process lasts for 30 days.  
|    b. The inspection process must be officially announced and publicised.  
|    c. Property owners whose addresses are known shall in addition be informed by normal post of the public inspection process and of the rights of objection and appeal available to them.  
|    d. The property owner shall be provided on demand with a copy of the relevant extract from the Land Registry Plan.  
|    e. An appeal against a decision made under the objection procedure may be lodged with the cantonal authority, which examines the decision unconditionally.
