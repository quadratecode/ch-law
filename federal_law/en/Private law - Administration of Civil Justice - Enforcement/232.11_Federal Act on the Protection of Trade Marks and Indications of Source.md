## [Chapter 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#tit_1/chap_1)

### [Section 1 Trade Mark Protection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#tit_1/chap_1/sec_1)

[**Art. 1** Definition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_1) 

[1] A trade mark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings.

[2] Trade marks may, in particular, be words, letters, numerals, figurative representations, three-dimensional shapes or combinations of such elements with each other or with colours.

[**Art. 2** Absolute grounds for refusal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_2) 

Excluded from trade mark protection are:


|    a. signs that are in the public domain, except where they have become established as a trade mark through use for the goods or services for which they are being claimed.  
|    b. shapes that constitute the nature of the goods themselves or shapes of the goods or their packaging that are technically necessary.  
|       
|    c. misleading signs;  
|    d. signs contrary to public policy, morality or applicable law.

[**Art. 3** Relative grounds for refusal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_3) 

[1] Also excluded from trade mark protection are signs that are:


|    a. identical to an earlier trade mark and are intended for the same goods or services;  
|    b. identical to an earlier trade mark and intended for similar goods or services such that a likelihood of confusion results.  
|    c. similar to an earlier trade mark and intended for the same or similar goods or services such that a likelihood of confusion results.

[2] An earlier trade mark is:


|    a. a filed or registered trade mark that gives rise to a right of priority under this Act (Art. 6-8).  
|    b. a trade mark that is well known in Switzerland within the meaning of Article 6[bis]of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 20 March 1883 (Paris Convention) at the time of filing the sign referred to in paragraph 1.

[3] The grounds for refusal under this Article may only be invoked by the proprietor of the earlier trade mark.

[**Art. 4** Registration in favour of the authorised user](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_4) 

Trade marks registered in the name of agents, representatives or other authorised users without the consent of the proprietor, or trade marks which remain entered in the Register after the withdrawal of such consent, are also not protected.

### [Section 2 Establishment of a Trade Mark Right; Priority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#tit_1/chap_1/sec_2)

[**Art. 5** Establishment of a trade mark right](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_5) 

A trade mark right is established on entry in the Register.

[**Art. 6** Right of Priority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_6) 

A trade mark right belongs to the person who first files the trade mark.

[**Art. 7** Priority under the Paris Convention](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_7) 

[1] Where a trade mark is first duly filed in another Member State of the Paris Convention or with effect in such a Member State, the applicant or successor in title may claim the date of the first filing for the filing of the same trade mark in Switzerland, provided the filing in Switzerland takes place within six months of the date of the first filing.

[2] The first filing in a state that grants reciprocity to Switzerland has the same effect as the first filing in a Member State of the Paris Convention.

[**Art. 8** Exhibition priority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_8) 

Any person who exhibits goods or services bearing a trade mark at an official or officially recognised exhibition under the Convention of 22 November 1928 Relating to International Exhibitions in a Member State of the Paris Convention, may claim the opening date of the exhibition for filing the application provided that the trade mark is filed within six months of this date. 

[**Art. 9** Declaration of priority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_9) 

[1] Any person who claims priority under the Paris Convention or exhibition priority must file a declaration of priority with the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property (IPI). The IPI may require the submission of a priority document.

[2] The claim is forfeited if the time limits and formal requirements laid down by the Ordinance are not complied with.

[3] Registration of priority is merely a presumption in favour of the proprietor of the trade mark.

### [Section 3 Existence of a Trade Mark Right](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#tit_1/chap_1/sec_3)

[1] A registration is valid for 10 years from the date of filing the application.

[2] A registration will be renewed for further periods of ten years if an application for renewal is submitted and the fees as set out in the Ordinance are paid.

[3] The application for renewal must be submitted to the IPI within the last 12 months prior to the expiry of the term of validity, but not later than six months after its expiry.

[4] ...

[**Art. 11** Use of the trade mark](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_11) 

[1] A trade mark is protected if it is used in relation to the goods or services for which it is claimed.

[2] Use in a manner not significantly different from the registered trade mark and use for export purposes also constitute use of the trade mark.

[3] Use of the trade mark with the consent of the proprietor is considered to be use by the proprietor himself.

[**Art. 12** Consequences of non-use](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_12) 

[1] Where the proprietor has not used the trade mark in relation to the goods or services for which it is claimed for an uninterrupted period of five years following the expiry of the opposition period with no opposition having been filed or upon conclusion of opposition proceedings, he may no longer assert his right to the trade mark, unless there are proper reasons for non-use.

[2] If use of the trade mark is commenced or resumed after more than five years, the right to the trade mark is restored with effect from the original priority date, unless non-use of the trade mark has been invoked under paragraph 1 prior to its commencement or resumption of use.

[3] Any person who invokes non-use of a trade mark is required to substantiate his claim; evidence of use is required to be provided by the proprietor of the trade mark.

### [Section 4 Rights Conferred by a Registered Trade Mark](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#tit_1/chap_1/sec_4)

[**Art. 13** Exclusive right](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_13) 

[1] A trade mark right confers on the proprietor the exclusive right to use the trade mark to identify the goods or services for which it is claimed and to dispose of it.

|    a. affixing the sign to goods or their packaging;  
|    b. offering goods, placing them on the market or storing them for such purposes under the sign;  
|    c. offering or providing services under the sign;  
|    d. importing, exporting or carrying in transit goods under the sign;  
|    e. using the sign on business papers, in advertising, or otherwise in the course of trade.

[3] The proprietor of the trade mark may also assert the rights under this Article against authorised users in terms of Article 4.

[**Art. 14** Limitation concerning previously used signs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_14) 

[1] The proprietor of a trade mark may not prohibit another person from continuing to use a sign to the same extent as already previously used prior to the filing of the application.

[1] The proprietor of a famous trade mark may prohibit others from using his trade mark for any type of goods or services if such use threatens the distinctiveness of the trade mark or exploits or damages its reputation.

[2] Rights acquired before the trade mark became famous remain unaffected.

[**Art. 16** Reproduction of trade marks in dictionaries and other reference works](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_16)

[2] The other provisions of this Act apply except where the Madrid Agreement, the Madrid Protocol or this Chapter provide otherwise.

[1] An international registration with effect in Switzerland has the same effect as the filing of an application with the IPI and registration in the Swiss Register. 

[2] Such effect does not arise if and to the extent the internationally registered trade mark has been refused protection in Switzerland.

[**Art. 46***a* Conversion of an international registration into a national application for registration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_46_a)

# [Title 2 Indications of Source](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#tit_2)

[**Art. 47** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_47) 

[1] Indications of source are direct or indirect references to the geographical origin of goods or services, including references to their characteristics or the quality associated with their origin.

[2] Geographical names and signs that are not understood by the relevant public as indicating a certain origin of the goods or services, are not considered indications of source within the meaning of paragraph 1.

[3] It is prohibited to use:


|    a. incorrect indications of source;  
|    b. designations that may be confused with an incorrect indication of source;  
|    c. a name, a company name, an address or a trade mark associated with goods or services of a different origin where this could be misleading.

[3bis] Where indications of source are used with additions such as «kind», «type», «style» or «imitation», the same requirements must be fulfilled that apply to the use of indications of source without these additions.

[3ter] Indications regarding research or design or other specific activities associated with the product may only be used if this activity takes place entirely at the specified location.

[4] Regional or local indications of source for services are considered to be correct if such services satisfy the criteria of origin for the country concerned as a whole.

[**Art. 48**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_48) [Indications of source for goods](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_48) 

[1] Indications of source for goods are considered to be correct if the requirements under Articles 48*a-*48*c* are fulfilled.

[2] Any additional requirements such as compliance with manufacturing or processing principles or quality requirements that are customary or prescribed in the place of origin must also be fulfilled.

[3] In each individual case, all requirements are to be determined according to the understanding of the relevant public, and where applicable, in accordance with their influence on the reputation of the goods concerned.

[4] The place of origin or processing for Swiss indications of source for natural products and foodstuffs is the Swiss territory and customs union areas. The Federal Council may define the border areas, which are exceptionally considered as the place of origin or processing for Swiss indications of source.

[5] Where a foreign indication of source meets the statutory requirements of the country concerned, it is considered to be correct. Any possible misleading of consumers in Switzerland remains reserved.

[**Art. 48***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_48_a) [Natural products](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_48_a)

|    c. for meat: the place where the animals spent the predominant part of their lives;  
|    d. for other animal-derived products: the place where the animals were kept;

[1] Foodstuffs within the meaning of the Foodstuffs Act of 9 October 1992 (FSA) ​​fall under this provision, with the exception of natural products under Article 48*a* of this Act. The Federal Council shall regulate the differences in detail.

[2] The origin of a foodstuff is the place from which at least 80 per cent of the raw material weight that makes up the foodstuff comes from. For milk and dairy products, the weight of milk as the raw material must equal 100 per cent.

[3] Excluded from the calculation under paragraph 2 are:


|    a. natural products which, due to natural conditions, cannot be produced at the place of origin;  
|    b. natural products that are temporarily not available in sufficient quantities at the place of origin.

[4] For the calculation under paragraph 2, all raw materials for which the domestic self-supply rate is at least 50 per cent must be taken into account. Where the raw material self-supply rate is 20–49.9 per cent, only half of the raw materials are to be taken into account. Where the raw material self-supply rate is less than 20 per cent, the raw materials may be excluded from the calculation. The Federal Council shall regulate the details.

[5] In addition, the indication of source must correspond to the place where the processing, which has given the foodstuff its essential characteristics, has taken place.

[1] The origin of other products, in particular industrial products, corresponds to the place where at least 60 per cent of the manufacturing costs are incurred.

[2] For the calculation under paragraph 1, the following shall be taken into account:


|    a. production and assembly costs;  
|    b. research and development costs;  
|    c. costs for quality assurance and certification which are prescribed by law or standardised in an economic sector.

[3] Excluded from the calculation under paragraph 1 are:


|    a. costs for natural products which, due to natural conditions, cannot be produced at the place of origin;  
|    b. costs for raw materials which, in accordance with an ordinance under Article 50 paragraph 2, are not available in sufficient quantities at the place of origin for objective reasons;  
|    c. packaging costs;   
|    d. transport costs;  
|    e. the costs for distribution of the goods, as well as costs for marketing and customer service. 

[4] In addition, the indication of source must correspond to the place where the activity, which gave the product its essential characteristics, took place. In all cases, an essential manufacturing step must have been carried out at this place.

[**Art. 48***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_48_d) [Exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_48_d)

[1] The indication of source of a service is considered to be correct if:


|    a. it corresponds to the registered office of the person providing the service; and  
|    b. a place of effective administration of this person is located in the same country. 

[2] Where a parent company fulfils the requirements of paragraph 1 letter a, and either it or one of its subsidiaries effectively controlled by it and domiciled in the same country fulfils the requirements of paragraph 1 letter b, then the indication of source is also considered to be correct for similar services provided by the foreign subsidiaries and the branch offices of the parent company.

[3] Any additional requirements such as compliance with prescribed or customary principles of providing the service or the traditional association of the person providing the service with the country of origin must also be fulfilled.

[4] A foreign indication of source is considered to be correct where it meets the statutory requirements of the country concerned. Any possible misleading of consumers in Switzerland remains reserved.

[1] Where justified by consumer interests, the general interests of the economy or of individual sectors, the Federal Council may define the requirements under Articles 48 paragraph 2 and 48*a*–49 in greater detail.

[2] It may, in particular, at the request and based on a preliminary draft of an economic sector, define in greater detail the requirements under which a Swiss indication of source may be used for specific goods and services.

[3] It shall first hear the Cantons concerned and interested professional and trade associations, as well as consumer organisations.

[**Art. 50***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_50_a) [Register for geographical indications](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_50_a)

This obligation does not apply to the use of trade marks that are identical or similar to a registered geographical indication and which were filed or registered in good faith, or that have been acquired through use in good faith:


|    a. prior to 1 January 1996; or  
|    b. prior to the name of the registered geographical indication being protected in the country of origin, insofar as none of the grounds for nullity or revocation set out in this Act apply to the trade mark concerned.

[6] Where a trade mark containing a geographical indication, identical or similar to a geographical indication for which registration has been applied, is filed for identical or comparable goods, the trade mark examination procedure shall be suspended until the final decision on the application for registration of the geographical indication.

[7] Following registration of the geographical indication, the trade mark may only be registered for identical or comparable goods. The goods must be restricted to the geographical origin described in the product specifications.

[8] Registered geographical indications are protected in particular against:


|    a. any commercial use for other products, whereby the reputation of the protected designation is exploited;   
|    b. any act of appropriation, counterfeiting or imitation.

[**Art. 51** Producer identification mark](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_51) 

Where the interests of an economic sector so require, the Federal Council may prescribe that a producer identification mark be affixed to goods of that economic sector.

[1] The plaintiff may bring an action for the assignment of the trade mark instead of a declaration of nullity of the trade mark registration if the defendant has usurped the trade mark.

[2] This right shall lapse two years after publication of the registration or after withdrawal of the proprietor’s consent under Article 4.

[3] If the court orders the assignment, then licences or other rights granted to third parties in the intervening period lapse; however, if they have used the trade mark commercially in Switzerland in good faith or have made special preparations for this purpose, these third parties are entitled to be granted a non-exclusive licence.

[4] Any claims for damages remain reserved.

[**Art. 54**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_54) [Notification of decisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/274_274_274/en#art_54)

|    a. to prohibit an imminent infringement;   
|    b. to remedy an existing infringement;

[2] Actions brought under the Code of Obligations for damages, satisfaction and handing over of profits in accordance with the provisions concerning agency without authority remain reserved.

[2bis] An action for performance may be instituted only after the entry of the trade mark in the Register. Claims for damages may be made retroactively from the time at which the defendant obtained knowledge of the content of the application for registration.

[3] The use of a guarantee or collective mark contrary to the applicable regulations also constitutes an infringement of a trade mark right.

[4] Any person who holds an exclusive licence is entitled to bring a separate action irrespective of the registration of the licence in the Register unless this is expressly excluded in the licence agreement. Any licensees may join an infringement action in order to claim for their own damages.
