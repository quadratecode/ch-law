[**Art. 2**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_2) [Cantonal implementation plan](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_2) 

The cantonal implementation plan details the nature, extent, timetable and costs of the work of official cadastral surveying, including:


|    a. initial survey work;  
|    b. renovation work;  
|    c. work relating to change of exceptional national interest;  
|    d. periodic updating;  
|    e. the replacement of provisional digitising by initial survey (resurvey) or by renovation of the existing survey;

[**Art. 3** Division into tolerance levels](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_3) 

For the purposes of official cadastral surveying the territory of the Confederation is divided into a range of tolerance levels (TS) as follows:

TS1: Urban areas

TS2: Built-up areas and building zones

TS3: Areas of intensive agriculture and forestry 

TS4: Areas of extensive agriculture and forestry

TS5: Summer pastures and unproductive areas

[**Art. 3**[bis]](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_3_bis) [Numbering range](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_3_bis) 

A numbering range is a component of an identification system, with corresponding geometry, defining the range of validity of unique identifiers. Numbering ranges are allocated by the Confederation and by the cantons.

[**Art. 16** Vegetated areas](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_16) 

[1] Vegetated areas comprise cultivated and uncultivated soil with the exception of woodland.

[2] «Other intensive cultivation» objects notably include orchards and market gardens.

[3] «Garden» objects include pleasure gardens and parks, children’s playgrounds, bushes, trees, shrubs and vegetable patches, lawns and land surrounding houses.

[4] «Other vegetated area» objects notably include roadside verges and central reservations as well as river banks.

[**Art. 17** Waters](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_17) 

[1] Waters comprise all water areas with the exception of artificial pools, ponds and basins.

[2] «Flowing water (watercourse)» objects notably include rivers, streams and canals, while «standing water» objects cover lakes and ponds. In general the geometrical boundary is recognisable for natural banks by the change of land cover type, and for artificial banks by the structures in question. Bank stabilisation structures are classified in accordance with the corresponding type of land cover.

[3] «Reed belt» objects include areas covered with reeds which form the transition between open water and dry land. Isolated stands of reeds within water areas are not surveyed.

[**Art. 18** Woodland](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_18) 

[1] Woodland areas includes forest as defined in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Federal Act of 4th October 1991 on Forest (Forest Act, ForA).

[2] Areas subject to a duty of reafforestation (ForA Art. 2 para. 2 let. c) are treated as planned objects.

[3] The geometrical delimitation of forests may if necessary be carried out in cooperation with the responsible forest authorities.

[4] Extensive shelter belts outside built-up areas are to be surveyed and treated as woodland.

[5] «Wooded pasture» objects comprise areas as defined in Article 2 of the Forest Ordinance of 30 November 1992.

[6] The areas of «wooded pasture» objects are subdivided into «densely wooded pasture» and «open wooded pasture» objects purely for cartographic purposes.

[7] «Other wooded areas» objects include grazed woodland and trees in parkland, trees on river banks and along streams, mixed areas of forest with pasture, rock and scree, and transitional zones at the climatic/altitudinal limit of forest, insofar as the area cannot be classified either as «dense forest» or «wooded pasture». 

[**Art. 19** Unvegetated areas](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_19) 

[1] Areas which are not usable for agriculture or forestry are considered to be unvegetated.

[2] «Other unvegetated area» objects include mixed zones between grass and rock or scree, especially areas of scrub and rocks and transitional zones at the climatic/altitudinal limit of vegetation.

### [Section 3 «Single Objects»](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#tit_2/chap_2/sec_3) [Layer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#tit_2/chap_2/sec_3)

[**Art. 20**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_20) [Relationship with the «land cover» layer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_20) 

The «single objects» layer comprises objects that possess some characteristics of land cover but which, because of their nature or their small extent, have minimal importance in terms of area coverage.

[**Art. 21** Objects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_21) 

Objects must be explicitly assigned to the «single objects» layer if:


|    a. they are not buildings in accordance with Article 14, for example underground structures, bays or balconies;  
|    b. their clear delimitation as areas is not possible or their survey as area objects would entail disproportionate cost, for example rivulets, small streams, faint paths, irregular footpaths, watercourses and mountain torrents;  
|    c. they are of linear character, such as railway lines; or  
|    d. they are portrayed on the Land Registry Plan as symbols, for example isolated important trees.

### [Section 4 «Heights» Layer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#tit_2/chap_2/sec_4)

[1] The «heights» layer consists of a digital terrain model (DTM).

[2] The DTM data must be capable of supply in the form of a 2-metre grid.

[3] The origin of the 2-metre grid has the following values in the national coordinate systems:


|    a. CH1903 reference system of the reference frame of the Swiss national survey of 1903 (LV03): y = 600 000.00 m (easting) and x = 200 000.00 m (northing);  
|    b. CH1903+ reference system of the reference frame of the Swiss national control network of 1995 (LV95): E = 2 600 000.00 m (easting) and N = 1 200 000.00 m (northing).

[4] The cantons may in addition offer the data in an alternative form derived from the DTM.

[**Art. 23**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_23)

[1] The accuracy and reliability requirements are governed by the tolerance levels (TS).

[2] For large areas with very low land value, for which the accuracy and reliability characteristics of the specified tolerance levels are not necessary, simplified surveying may be performed, subject to approval by the Federal Directorate of Cadastral Surveying.

[**Art. 25** Minimum requirement for TS1](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_25) 

[1] TS1 (urban areas) must at least satisfy the requirements for TS2.

[2] Article 28 is reserved.

[**Art. 26**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_26) [Assignment of tolerance levels](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_26) 

[1] The canton lays down tolerance levels for each individual case.

[2] It shall designate the areas to which Article 24 paragraph 2 is to apply.

### [Section 2 Accuracy](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_2)

[**Art. 27** Basic principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_27) 

The requirements for the accuracy of points of official cadastral surveying are defined in terms of mean square errors (standard deviations) and refer to connection points. These apply to all new computations.

[**Art. 28**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_28) [«Control points» layer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_28) 

[1] The absolute planimetric accuracy (semi-major axis of the error ellipse [standard (Helmert) error ellipse], (σ) in cm) is specified as follows for the respective point categories and tolerance levels:



|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

[**Art. 46** Definition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_46) 

[1] Control points are connection points of official cadastral surveying whose coordinates are determined in the reference system of the Swiss national survey through surveying and adjustment procedures, and they are clearly and permanently identifiable in the field by means of control point monuments.

[2] Control point coordinates are determined in planimetry and/or altimetry.

[**Art. 47** Classification](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1864_1864_1864/en#art_47) 

[1] Control points are divided into those of the Swiss national survey and those of official cadastral surveying. In general planimetric control points (LFP) are fixed in terms of both planimetric coordinates and height above sea level, while altimetric control points (HFP) relate to height above sea level, with their planimetric coordinates determined to lower accuracy.

[2] Planimetric control points are divided into those of the Swiss national survey (category 1: LFP1) and those of official cadastral surveying (category 2: LFP2 and category 3: LFP3).

[3] Altimetric control points are divided into those of the Swiss national survey (category 1: HFP1) and those of official cadastral surveying (category 2: HFP2 and category 3: HFP3).

[4] Additional points which are not permanently monumented, but which are needed for detail survey, setting out or strengthening the network, must meet the same specifications as the LFP.
