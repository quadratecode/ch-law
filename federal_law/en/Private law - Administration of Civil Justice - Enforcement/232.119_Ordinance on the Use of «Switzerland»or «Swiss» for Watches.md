28 August 1992 (TmPA),

ordains:

[**Art. 1**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_1) [Definition of «watch»](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_1) 

[1] The term «watch» means the following:


|    a. time-measuring devices intended to be worn on the wrist;  
|    b. devices whose main function is to measure time and whose movement:  
|    1. does not exceed 60 mm in width, length or diameter, or  
|    2. does not exceed 14 mm in thickness measured with the plate and bridges.



[2] When determining the width, length, diameter and thickness, only the technically necessary dimensions are taken into consideration.

[3] The component that enables the watch to be worn is not included in the definition of the term «watch» specified in paragraph 1.

[**Art. 1***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_1_a) [Definition of a Swiss watch](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_1_a) 

A watch is considered to be a Swiss watch if:


|    a. at least the following elements of its technical development are carried out in Switzerland:  
|    1. for exclusively mechanical watches: the mechanical construction and prototyping of the watch as a whole,  
|    2. for watches that are not exclusively mechanical: the mechanical con­struction and prototyping of the watch as a whole, as well as the design of the printed circuits, the display and the software;


|    a[bis]. its movement is Swiss;  
|    b. its movement is cased up in Switzerland;  
|    c. the final inspection of the watch is conducted by the manufacturer in Switzerland; and  
|    d. at least 60 per cent of the manufacturing costs are incurred in Switzerland.

[**Art. 2** Definition of a Swiss movement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_2)

[1] A movement is considered to be a Swiss movement if:


|    a. at least the following elements of its technical development are carried out in Switzerland:  
|    1. for exclusively mechanical watch movements: the mechanical construction and prototyping of the watch movement as a whole,  
|    2. for watch movements that are not exclusively mechanical: the mechanical construction and prototyping of the watch as a whole, as well as the design of the printed circuits, the display and the software;


|    a[bis]. it is assembled in Switzerland;  
|    b. it is inspected by the manufacturer in Switzerland;  
|    b[bis]. at least 60 per cent of the manufacturing costs are incurred in Switzerland; and  
|    c. the constituent parts made in Switzerland, excluding the cost of assembling them, represent at least 50 per cent of the value of all of the constituent parts.

[2] To calculate the value of the constituent parts made in Switzerland in accordance with paragraph 1 letter c, the following rules apply:


|    a. …  
|    a[bis]. the cost of the dial is included if the dial:  
|    1. performs an electronic function for the watch, and  
|    2. is used to equip the watch with an electro-optical display or a solar module;


|    b. assembly costs may be taken into consideration if a certification procedure provided for in an international treaty ensures that, as a result of close industrial cooperation, foreign and Swiss constituent parts are equivalent in quality;  
|    c. the assembly costs taken into consideration may not exceed the value of the foreign constituent parts recognised as being equivalent that are incorporated into the Swiss movement concerned.

[3] The provisions of the Additional Agreement of 20 July 1972 to the Agreement concerning products of the clock and watch industry between the European Economic Community and its Member States and the Swiss Confederation applies.

[**Art. 2***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_2_a) [Definition of Swiss constituent parts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_2_a) 

Constituent parts are considered to be Swiss if:


|    a. they are inspected by the manufacturer in Switzerland; and  
|    b. at least 60 per cent of their manufacturing costs are incurred in Switzerland.

[**Art. 2***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_2_b) [Definition of assembly in Switzerland](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_2_b) 

A watch movement is considered to have been assembled in Switzerland within the meaning of Article 2 paragraph 1 letter a[bis] if all of the constituent parts are assembled in Switzerland. Only the subassembly of the following constituent parts may be carried out abroad:


|    a. for exclusively mechanical watch movements: the gear trains;  
|    b. for watch movements that are not exclusively mechanical:  
|    1. the electronic modules,  
|    2. the electro-optical display modules,  
|    3. the energy collecting module,  
|    4. the regulating organ,  
|    5. the gear trains,  
|    6. the motor or motors, including the rotors and coils they are made of.



[**Art. 2***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_2_c) [Relevant manufacturing costs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1971/1908_1915_1915/en#art_2_c) 

Excluded from the calculation of the manufacturing costs are:


|    a. costs for natural products which, due to natural conditions, cannot be produced in Switzerland;  
|    b. costs for materials which, for objective reasons, are not available in Switzerland in sufficient quantities, up to their unavailability rate;  
|    c. packaging costs;  
|    d. transport costs;  
|    e. costs for the commercialisation of the goods, as well as costs for marketing and customer service;

If the watchmaking industry publishes information in accordance with Article 52*k* of the Trade Mark Protection Ordinance of 23 December 1992 about materials that are not available in sufficient quantities in Switzerland, it shall ensure that such information is objectively justified. In the event of disagreement within the industry, it will consult with independent third parties.
