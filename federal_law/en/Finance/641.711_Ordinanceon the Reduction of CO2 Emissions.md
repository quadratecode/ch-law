[1bis] It shall decide whether to issue attestations on the basis of the information mentioned in paragraph 1.

[2] Attestations for projects are issued for the extent to which emission reductions have demonstrably been achieved up to the end of the crediting period.

[3] Attestations for programmes are issued for the extent to which emission reductions have demonstrably been achieved for no longer than ten years after the end of the programme’s crediting period, if the relevant planned component activity has been started during the crediting period.

[4] Emission reductions that are attributable to non-refundable payments from the Confederation, cantons or communes for promoting renewable energies, energy efficiency or climate protection are only attested to the applicant if it proves that the responsible public bodies have not otherwise claimed the emission reductions. Emission reductions that are attributable to funds obtained on the basis of Article 19 in conjunction with Article 21 or of Articles 25, 27, 32 and 73 paragraph 4 of the Energy Act of 30 September 2016 (EnA) are not attested.

[5] The added ecological value of emission reductions is compensated with the issuance of attestations. If the added ecological value has already been compensated for, no attestations are issued.

[**Art. 11** Substantial modifications to the project or programme](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_11) 

[1] Substantial modifications of the project or programme carried out after the decision has been made regarding qualification or the extension of the crediting period must be reported to the FOEN.

[2] A modification to the project or programme is in particular deemed substantial if:


|    a. actual emission reductions deviate from the expected annual emission reductions specified in the project or programme description by more than 20 per cent;

[**Art. 17**  Scope of application](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_17)

[1] The provisions of this Chapter apply to any person who imports into Switzerland or manufactures in Switzerland a passenger car, van or light articulated vehicle which is then placed on the market for the first time.

[2] Vehicles that are placed on the market for the first time are those that are registered for use in Switzerland for the first time and whose use specified in their initial registration corresponds to their actual use by the end user.

[2bis] Imported vehicles that have been registered for use abroad more than six months before the customs declaration are not regarded as registered for the first time.

3 Placing on the market in a customs enclave in accordance with Article 3 paragraph 3 of the Customs Act of 18 March 2005 (CustA) and in Liechtenstein is deemed registration in Switzerland. Registration in a customs enclave in accordance with Article 3 paragraph 2 CustA, with the exception of Liechtenstein, is deemed placing on the market abroad.

[4] If the deadline specified in paragraph 1 leads to the significant unequal treatment of importers of vehicles that have already been registered abroad before a customs declaration in Switzerland and importers of vehicles that have not been registered abroad before a customs declaration in Switzerland, or should misuses occur, then DETEC may:


|    a. shorten or extend the deadline by no more than one year;  
|    b. define a required minimum number of kilometres covered.

[1] An importer is deemed to be a large-scale importer of passenger cars in the reference year in relation to its fleets of new vehicles if at least 50 passenger cars from these fleets were registered for the first time in the year before the reference year.

[2] An importer is deemed to be a large-scale importer of vans or light articulated vehicles in the reference year in relation to its fleets of new vehicles if at least six such vehicles from these fleets were registered for the first time in the year before the reference year.

[**Art. 19** Provisional treatment as a large-scale importer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_19) 

[1] An importer may apply to the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) to be provisionally treated as a large-scale importer in the reference year in relation to its fleets of new vehicles if no more than 49 passenger cars or, where applicable, no more than five vans or light articulated vehicles were registered for the first time from these fleets in the year before the reference year.

[2] Passenger cars or, where applicable, vans or light articulated vehicles that are registered for the first time in the reference year after the date on which the application in terms of paragraph 1 is approved shall be included in the relevant fleet of new vehicles.

[3] If no more than 49 passenger cars or, where applicable, no more than five vans or light articulated vehicles are registered for the first time in the reference year, the importer must account individually for each vehicle in the relevant fleet of new vehicles.

[**Art. 20** Small-scale importers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_20) 

An importer is deemed to be small-scale importer be in relation to its fleets of new vehicles in the reference year if it registered no more than 49 passenger cars or, where applicable, no more than five vans or light articulated vehicles from its fleets for the first time in the year before the reference year and if it is not provisionally treated as a large-scale importer in the reference year.

[**Art. 21** Manufacturer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_21) 

Depending on the number of a manufacturer’s vehicles that are registered for the first time in the year before the reference year, either the provisions of this Chapter for large-scale importers or those for small-scale importers apply to that manufacturer by analogy in the reference year.

[**Art. 22** Emission pools](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_22) 

[1] Importers and manufacturers that wish to be treated as an emission pool must apply to the SFOE by 30 November of the year before the reference year to be treated as an emission pool for a duration of one to five years.

[2] An emission pool must appoint a representative.

## [Section 3 Bases for Assessments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#chap_3/sec_3)

[**Art. 23** Documentation to be submitted](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_23) 

[1] A vehicle imported by a large-scale importer may not be registered until the Federal Roads Office (FEDRO) has, by submission of a type approval, been notified of the data required for calculating any sanction and for the allocation of the vehicle to a fleet of new vehicles.

[2] In the case of vehicles without type approval, the large-scale importer must submit the following documentation to FEDRO before the vehicle is registered for the first time:


|    a. the completed inspection report in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 3 of the Ordinance of 19 June 1995 on the Type Approval of Road Vehicles (RVTAO);  
|    b. the application for attestation; and  
|    c. any evidence required in accordance with Article 25 paragraph 1 or 2.

[3] A vehicle imported by a small-scale importer may be registered for the first time if the small-scale importer has paid FEDRO the sanction in accordance with Article 13 of the CO2 Act where a sanction is due, and has submitted the following documentation:


|    a. the completed inspection report in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 3 RVTAO;  
|    b. the application for attestation;  
|    c. any evidence required in accordance with Article 24 paragraph 1 or 3 or Article 25 paragraph 1 or 2.

[4] If an importer wishes to have a vehicle that it has imported accounted for in the fleet of new vehicles of a large-scale importer, it must notify FEDRO of this before the vehicle is registered for the first time by applying for attestation. The application must include the signature of the large-scale importers assuming responsibility.

[**Art. 24** CO2 emissions and unladen weight of vehicles with type approval](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_24) 

[1] When determining CO2 emissions, the following data are decisive:


|    a. subject to paragraph 1[ter], the data in the type approval in accordance with the RVTAO: provided the values are determined in accordance with the Regulation (EU) 2017/1151 (WLTP values);  
|    b. the CO2 emissions determined in accordance with Article 25: if no WLTP values are available.

[1bis] To determine the unladen weight, the data in the type approval in accordance with the RVTAO are decisive, subject to paragraph 1[ter].

[1ter] The data in the type approval are not decisive if the importer submits the data under paragraph 3 or 4 to FEDRO within the relevant deadline.

[2] If details of the unladen weight are not included in the type approval of vans and light articulated vehicles, the unladen weight recorded at the vehicle inspection in the inspection report in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 3 RVTAO is decisive.

[3] The importer may submit the following data to FEDRO within the deadline in paragraph 5:


|    a. for passenger cars, vans and light articulated vehicles, the following data based on the certificate of conformity (COC) in accordance with Article 18 of Directive 2007/46/EC or Article 36 of Regulation (EU) 2018/858:   
|    1. the vehicle identification number,  
|    2. the CO2 emissions (combined) in accordance with Position 49.4,  
|    3. any innovative technologies (eco-innovations) recognised under Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/631, and  
|    4. the unladen weight if available in accordance with Position 13.2, otherwise in accordance with Position 13;


|    b. for vans and light articulated vehicles with multi-stage type approval in accordance with Article 3 point 7 of Directive 2007/46/EC or Article 3 number 8 of Regulation (EU) 2018/858:  
|    1. the data in accordance with letter a points 1 and 3, and  
|    2. the CO2 emissions and the unladen weight determined in accordance with Annex III Part A number 1.2.2 of Regulation (EU) 2019/631.



[4] For vehicles with type approval that are converted to use a different fuel before the vehicle is registered for the first time, the evidence in accordance with Article 25 paragraph 1 letters b–d must be submitted to FEDRO within the deadline in accordance with paragraph 5. 

[5] The data and evidence in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 must be submitted by the 31 January following the reference year or, in the case of a small-scale importers, before the vehicle is registered for the first time.

[6] In order to verify the data in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4, FEDRO and the SFOE may require the importer to submit the COC in original form.

[**Art. 25** CO2 emissions and unladen weight of vehicles without type approval](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_25) 

[1] In determining the CO2 emissions and unladen weights of vehicles that are exempt from type approval (Art. 4 RVTAO), the following evidence is decisive insofar as the CO2 emissions are WLTP values:


|    a. the data based on the COC in accordance with Article 24 paragraph 3 letter a;  
|    b. written evidence contained in an inspection report from an inspection centre listed in Annex 2 RVTAO (conformity assessment) or a foreign inspection centre (conformity certificate) that the vehicle complies with the Swiss regulations;  
|    c. the approval of a foreign state in accordance with national or international law that is listed in Annex 2 RVTRO or which is at least equivalent to the Swiss regulations; or  
|    d. the inspection report from an inspection centre that is competent in accordance with Annex 2 RVTAO or which has been provisionally licensed by FEDRO in accordance with Article 17 paragraph 2 RVTAO.

[2] If the vehicle is a van or a light articulated vehicle with a multi-stage type approval in accordance with Article 3 point 7 of Directive 2007/46/EC or under Article 3 number 8 of Regulation (EU) 2018/858, in determining the CO2 emissions and the weights of the completed vehicle the evidence in accordance with paragraph 1 letters b–d and in accordance with Article 24 paragraph 3 letter b is decisive.

[3] In the case of vehicles for which no WLTP values are available based on the evidence under paragraphs 1 or 2, the CO2 emissions are calculated in accordance with Annex 4. The unladen weight in kg in accordance with Article 7 RVTRO is decisive. The importer must provide proof of this unladen weight value in the form of a certificate of weight unless it can be ascertained from the documents specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 or the COC.

[4] If the CO2 emissions of a vehicle cannot be calculated in accordance with paragraph 3, passenger cars shall be assumed to produce emissions of 300 g CO2/km and vans and light articulated vehicles 400 g CO2/km.

[**Art. 26**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_26) [CO2-reducing factors for vehicles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_26) 

[1] If the average CO2 emissions of a fleet of new vehicles of a large-scale importer or of any vehicle of a small-scale importer are reduced by using eco-innovations, the reduction shall be taken into account up to a maximum of 7g CO2/km.

[2] The CO2 reductions achieved as a result of eco-innovations that are indicated in the COC shall be multiplied by the following factors and the result arithmetically rounded up to the next tenth of a gram CO2/km: 


|    a. in the reference year 2021: 1.9;  
|    b. in the reference year 2022: 1.7;  
|    c. in the reference year 2023: 1.5.

[3] In the case of vehicles that can be fuelled by a mixture of natural gas and biogas, the percentage of the biogenic component under Article 12*a* paragraph 2 the Energy Efficiency Ordinance of 1 November 2017 shall be deducted from the CO2 emissions; the result shall be arithmetically rounded up to the next tenth of a gram CO2/km.

[**Art. 27** Calculating the average CO2 emissions for large-scale importers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_27) 

[1] The average CO2 emissions of a fleet of new vehicles of a large-scale importer is calculated based on the arithmetical mean of the CO2 emissions of the passenger cars or, where applicable, vans and light articulated vehicles of the large-scale importer registered for the first time in the reference year, rounded to three decimal places. 

[2] In order to calculate the average CO2 emissions of a fleet of new vehicles in accordance with paragraph 1, the following percentage of vehicles from the fleet of new vehicles with the lowest CO2 emissions in the reference years 2020–2022 shall be taken into account:


|    a. in the reference year 2020: 85 per cent;  
|    b. in the reference year 2021: 90 per cent;  
|    c. in the reference year 2022: 95 per cent.

[3] In order to calculate the average CO2 emissions of a fleet of new vehicles in accordance with paragraph 1, vehicles with CO2 emissions of less than 50 g CO2/km shall be taken into account for the reference years 2020–2022 as follows:


|    a. in the reference year 2020: double;  
|    b. in the reference year 2021: 1.67 times;  
|    c. in the reference year 2022: 1.33 times.

[4] The multiple accounting for vehicles under paragraph 3 applies only up to a reduction in the average CO2 emissions of the fleet of new vehicles of a maximum total of 9.3 g CO2/km in accordance with the WLTP. Reductions achieved in 2020, the extent of which have been determined using measurement methods applied the until the end of 2020, shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.24.

[**Art. 28** Individual target](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_28) 

[1] The individual target for CO2 emissions of the fleet of new vehicles of a large-scale importer or of the individual vehicle of a small-scale importer is calculated in accordance with Annex 4*a*.

[2] If a manufacturer has been granted a derogation from the target in accordance with Article 10 of Ordinance (EC) No 510/2011, the individual target shall be modified for the makes of vehicle concerned; in doing so Regulation (EC) No 510/2011 shall be taken into account.

[2bis] If no WLTP-based target has been published for a vehicle under paragraph 2 by the start of a reference year, for this vehicle in this reference year the target based on the measurement method applied until the end of 2020 shall be multiplied by the following factors: 


|    a. 1.24 for cars for which a derogation under Article 10 paragraph 4 of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 has been granted;  
|    b. 1.09 for cars for which a derogation under Article 10 paragraph 1 of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 has been granted;  
|    c. 1.27 for vans and light articulated vehicles.

[3] If a large-scale importer wishes to have vehicles with a modified individual target accounted for, it must notify the SFOE of this before any vehicle is registered for the first time in the reference year. These vehicles, irrespective of their number, each be accounted for as a separate fleet of new vehicles.

[**Art. 29** Sanction amounts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_29) 

[1] DETEC shall determine the amounts in accordance with Article 13 paragraph 1 of the CO2 Act each year for the following reference year in Annex 5. It shall use as a basis the amounts applicable in the European Union in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 and the exchange rate in accordance with paragraph 2.

[2] For the conversion into Swiss francs, the average daily exchange rate for selling francs in the twelve months prior to 30 June in the year before the reference year applies.

## [Section 4 Calculating and Collecting the Sanction from Large-Scale Importers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#chap_3/sec_4)

[1] At the end of the reference year, the SFOE shall check for each large-scale importer whether the average CO2 emissions of the fleet of new vehicles exceed the individual target.

[2] Emissions exceeding the individual target are rounded down to the nearest tenth of a gram of CO2/km to calculate the penalty.

[3] If the individual target is exceeded, the SFOE determines the sanction in accordance with Article 13 paragraph 1 of the CO2 Act and Annex 5 and draws up the final invoice, taking into account any advance payments in accordance with Article 31 paragraph 2.

[4] If the final invoice results in a surplus in favour of the large-scale importer, the SFOE refunds the surplus.

[**Art. 31** Quarterly advance payments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_31) 

[1] The SFOE shall send each large-scale importer a quarterly list of vehicles first placed on the market in the current reference year, and cof the average CO2 emissions and the individual target for its fleets of new vehicles.

[2] It may invoice large-scale importers for quarterly advance payments for any sanction in the reference year, in particular if:


|    a. the importer is provisionally treated as a large-scale importer in the reference year;  
|    b. the large-scale importer is based abroad;  
|    c. the large-scale importer is currently subject to debt enforcement proceedings or has existing certificates of loss;  
|    d. the average CO2 emissions of a fleet of new vehicles exceed the individual target in the reference year by more than 5g CO2 / km.

[3] The SFOE shall calculate the amount of the advance payments on the basis of the data in paragraph 1. Advance payments already made are taken into account in preparing the invoice.

[**Art. 32** Payment deadline and interest](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_32) 

[1] The large-scale importer shall pay the invoices and the final invoice within 30 days of receipt. 

[2] Refunds in accordance with Article 30 paragraph 4, plus interest on refunds, shall be made within the same period.

[3] If a large-scale importer does not pay an invoice or the final invoice on time, it shall owe interest on arrears.

4 The rates of interest on arrears and reimbursement interest are specified in the Annex to the FDF Ordinance of 10 December 1992 on the Due Date for and Interest on Direct Federal Taxes.

[**Art. 33** Sanction order](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_33) 

If a large-scale importer does not pay an invoice or a final invoice despite a reminder, the SFOE shall order the sanction.

[**Art. 34** Security](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_34) 

[1] If a large-scale importer is in arrears with the payment of an invoice, the SFOE may order it to be treated as a small-scale importer until the amount owed has been paid in full.

[2] If the SFOE considers the payment of the penalty or interest on arrears to be at risk, it may order that it be secured in the form of a cash deposit or a bank guarantee.

## [Section 5 Calculation and Levying of Sanctions for Small-Scale Importers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#chap_3/sec_5)


[**Art. 35**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_35) 

[1] For each vehicle of a small-scale importer, FEDRO shall check whether the CO2 emissions of the vehicle exceed the individual target. 

[2] If the individual target is exceeded, FEDRO shall determine the sanction in accordance with Article 13 paragraph 1 of the CO2 Act and Annex 5 and invoice it. In the reference years 2020–2022, the penalty for each vehicle shall be multiplied by the percentages in accordance with Article 27 paragraph 2.

[3] Articles 30 paragraph 2, 32 and 33 also apply.

[4] FEDRO is responsible for imposing the sanction in accordance with Article 33.

[**Art. 43** Installations not taken into account](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_43)

[1] In determining whether the conditions of Article 40 paragraph 1 or Article 42 paragraph 1 are met, and in calculating the extent to which the operator must surrender emission allowances annually to the Confederation, installations in hospitals are not taken into account.

[2] The installation operator may request that the following installations are not taken into account:


|    a. installations used exclusively for the research, development and testing of new products and processes;  
|    b. installations used primarily for the disposal of special waste in accordance with Article 3 letter c of the Waste Management Ordinance of 4 December 2015 (ADWO).

[3] For thermal fuels used in installations that are not taken into account, the CO2 levy is not refunded.

[**Art. 43***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_43_a) [Withdrawal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_43_a) 

An installation operator may, no later than 1 June, apply to withdraw from the ETS with effect from the beginning of the following year if it permanently ceases to meet the conditions of Article 40 paragraph 1 or 42 paragraph 1.

[**Art. 44**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_44) [Ruling](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_44) 

The FOEN decides by issuing a ruling on the participation of installation operators in the ETS and regarding installations not taken into account in accordance with Article 43.

[**Art. 45**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_45) [Maximum available quantity of emission allowances](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_45) 

[1] The FOEN shall calculate the available quantity of emission allowances each year for all installation operators in the ETS as a whole. The calculation is made in accordance with Annex 8.

[2] It shall each year retain a portion of the quantity calculated pursuant to paragraph 1 in order to make it accessible to the following installation operators: 


|    a. installation operators that are participating in the ETS for the first time pursuant to Article 46*a* paragraph 1; and   
|    b. installation operators that are already participating in the ETS, provided:   
|    1. they bring additional sub-installations under Article 46*a* paragraph 2 into operation, or   
|    2. the quantity of emission allowances to be allocated to them free of charge on the basis of Article 46*b* is increased.



[3] The portion under paragraph 2 is the sum of:


|    a. 5 per cent of the emission allowances under paragraph 1; and  
|    b. all the emission allowances that are no longer allocated free of charge based on:   
|    1. the exemption from the requirement to participate in the ETS under Article 41 or as a result of withdrawals from the ETS under Article 43*a*,  
|    2. adjustments under Article 46*b*,  
|    3. an incorrect or incomplete monitoring report (Art. 52 para. 8).



[4] If the portion under paragraph 2 is insufficient to meet claims in full, the emission allowances shall be allocated in the following order:

operators under Article 46*a* that have been participating in the ETS for at least one full calendar year; 

operators under Article 46*a*, that began participating in the ETS in the previous year; 

installation operators under paragraph 2 letter b number 2;

installation operators under Article 46*a* that are participating in the ETS for the first time in the year concerned.

[5] If the claims cannot be met in full within a group under paragraph 4 letter a, b or d, the time the installations came into operation determines how the emission allowances are allocated to the individual operators. If the claims cannot be met in full within the group under paragraph 4 letter c, the FOEN shall reduce the quantity of emission allowances allocated to the individual operators free of charge on a pro rata basis.

[**Art. 46**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_46) [Emission allowances to be allocated free of charge](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_46) 

[1] The FOEN calculates the quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge annually to installation operators, based on the benchmarks and adaptation factors described in Annex 9 and taking account of European Union regulations.

[2] If the total quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge exceeds the maximum quantity available minus the quantity in accordance with Article 45 paragraph 3 letter a, then the FOEN reduces the emission allowances allocated to individual installation operators pro rata.

[**Art. 46***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_46_a) [Allocating emission allowances free of charge to installation operators participating in the ETS for the first time and to installation operators with new sub-installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_46_a) 

[1] An installation operator that participates for the first time in the ETS after 1 January 2021 shall receive an allocation of emission allowances free of charge from the reserve in accordance with Article 45 paragraph 2 from the start of its participation in the ETS.

[2] If an operator already participating in the ETS brings an additional unit decisive for emission allowances to be allocated free of charge (a sub-installation) into operation, it shall be allocated emission allowances free of charge from the portion mentioned in Article 45 paragraph 2 from the start of operations.

# [Chapter 5 Commitment to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#chap_5)

[**Art. 66**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_66) [Requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_66) 

[1] In accordance with Article 31 paragraph 1 of the CO2 Act, an installation operator may commit to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions (operators with reduction obligations) if it:


|    a. is engaged in an activity listed in Annex 7;  
|    b. produces at least 60 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions due to an activity listed in Annex 7; and  
|    c. has emitted a total of more than 100 tonnes CO2eq of greenhouse gases in one of the preceding two years.

[2] The extent to which greenhouse gas emissions are reduced is determined by means of an emissions target or a measures target.

[3] Two or more installation operators may make a joint commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions if:


|    a. each of them is engaged in an activity listed in Annex 7;  
|    b. the source of at least 60 per cent of each of their greenhouse gas emissions is an activity listed in Annex 7; and  
|    c. together they have emitted more than 100 tonnes CO2eq of greenhouse gases in one of the preceding two years.

[4] The installation operators referred to in paragraph 3 are deemed a single operator. They must designate a representative.

[**Art. 67** Emissions target](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_67) 

[1] The emissions target is the maximum total amount of greenhouse gases that an installation operator may emit by the end of 2020.

[2] The FOEN calculates the emissions target on the basis of a linear reduction course.

[3] The linear reduction course is based on Article 31 paragraph 3 of the CO2 Act and:


|    a. on the greenhouse gas emissions of the installations in the preceding two years;  
|    b. on the state of the art of the technology used in the installations;  
|    c. on the already realised greenhouse-gas-effective measures and their effect;  
|    d. on the remaining reduction potential;  
|    e. on the economic efficiency of the possible greenhouse-gas-effective measures;  
|    f. on the portion of produced electricity that, in comparison with 2012, has additionally been used outside the installations;  
|    g. on the portion of district heating or cooling produced;  
|    h. on the extent to which CO2 levies can be saved.

[4] An installation operator that was under a reduction obligation in the years 2008–12 and would like to seamlessly continue from 2013 may apply for a simplified determination of the reduction course.

[5] A simplified determination of the reduction course is based on the greenhouse gas emissions of the installations in 2010 and 2011 and Article 3 of the CO2 Act. Insofar as installation operators have achieved additional reductions that exceed their commitments in the years 2008–12, this will be taken into account in determining the reduction course, except for additional reductions achieved as the result of using waste fuels.

[**Art. 68** Measures target](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_68) 

[1] An operator whose installations normally emit no more than 1500 tonnes CO2eq per year may request that the extent of its reduction be determined by means of a measures target.

[2] The measures target includes the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that the installation operator must reduce by the end of 2020 by means of measures.

[3] The measures target is determined based on Article 31 paragraph 3 of the CO2 Act and:


|    a. on the state of the art of the technology used in the installations;  
|    b. the remaining reduction potential;  
|    c. on the economic efficiency of the possible greenhouse-gas-effective measures;  
|    d. on the portion of produced electricity that, in comparison with 2012, has additionally been used outside the installations;  
|    e. on the portion of district heating or cooling produced;  
|    f. on the extent to which CO2 levies can be saved.

[**Art. 69** Application for the determination of a reduction obligation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_69) 

[1] An application for the determination of a reduction obligation must be submitted to the FOEN by 1 September of the previous year. On request, the FOEN may appropriately extend the application deadline. It issues guidelines on the form of the application.

[2] The application must contain information about:


|    a. the activities listed in Annex 7;  
|    b. the greenhouse gas emissions and production volumes of the preceding two years;  
|    c. the emissions target or measures target that the installation operator strives for.

[2bis] The proposal for the measures target must be prepared in consultation with one of the private organisations commissioned by the FOEN in accordance with Article 130 paragraph 6.

[3] The FOEN may request additional information if required for the determination of reduction obligations, particularly about:


|    a. the state of the art of the technology used in the installations;  
|    b. already implemented greenhouse-gas-effective measures, their effect and financing;  
|    c. the possible technical and economic greenhouse-gas-effective measures, with an evaluation of their effect and costs.

[4] It may request the installation operator to submit a monitoring plan in accordance with Article 51.

[**Art. 70** Ruling](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_70) 

The FOEN rules on reduction obligations.

[1] Emission reductions that an installation operator has achieved due to product improvements outside its own production plants may on request be taken into account towards meeting reduction obligations if they are:


|    a. analogous with the requirements of Article 5; and  
|    b. directly related to the installation operator’s activity.

[2] The procedure is described in Articles 6–11.

[**Art. 72**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_72) [Monitoring report](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_72) 

[1] An installation operator must submit annually by 31 May of the following year a monitoring report to a private organisation commissioned by the FOEN in accordance with Article 130 paragraph 6, which forwards the monitoring report to the FOEN.

[2] The monitoring report must contain:


|    a. information about the progression of greenhouse gas emissions;  
|    b. information about the progression of production volumes;  
|    c. an accounting of thermal fuels;  
|    d. a description of implemented greenhouse-gas-effective measures;  
|    e. information about possible deviations from the reduction course or measures target with a justification and planned corrective measures.

[3] The data must be contrasted in a summary table with comparative data from previous years. The FOEN defines the form of the monitoring report in a directive.

[4] The FOEN may request additional information if required for monitoring.

[**Art. 73** Amendment of the emissions target](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_73) 

[1] The FOEN shall amend the emissions target if the installations’ greenhouse gas emissions exceed or fall short of the reduction course due to a significant and permanent change in production amount or product mix or due to the procurement of heating or cooling from a third party:


|    a. in three consecutive years by at least 10 per cent per year; or  
|    b. in one year by at least 30 per cent.

[2] It amends the emissions target retroactively from the beginning of the year in which the installation operator’s greenhouse gas emissions first exceeded or fell short of the reduction course.

[3] It takes account of the criteria in Article 67 paragraph 3.

[**Art. 74** Amendment of the measures target](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_74) 

[1] The FOEN shall amend the measures target if the installations’ greenhouse gas emissions change significantly due to a change in production amount or product mix or due to the procurement of heating or cooling from a third party.

[2] It takes account of the criteria in Article 68 paragraph 3.

[**Art. 74***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_74_a) [Deducting attestations from the emissions target](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_74_a) 

Emission reductions resulting in the issuance of attestations in accordance with Article 12 paragraph 2 and emission reductions achieved under projects or programmes in accordance with Article 5 or 5*a* shall be considered to be the applicant’s greenhouse gas emissions with a view to meeting its emissions target.

[**Art. 74***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_74_b) [Adjustment of the reduction obligation of CHP plant operators](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_74_b)

[1] On request, the FOEN shall adjust the reduction obligation of CHP plant operators that apply for a refund of the CO2 levy in accordance with Article 96*a*.

[2] Applications must be submitted to the FOEN by 31 May of the following year. 

[3] Applications must contain information on:

[**Art. 75**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_75) [Counting emission reduction certificates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_75) 

[1] An installation operator that has not reached its emissions target or measures target and has not been issued attestations in accordance with Article 12 may have emission reduction certificates taken into account towards meeting its reduction obligations to the following extent:


|    a. for installation operators that were already subject to a reduction obligation in the years 2008–2012: 8 per cent of five times the average allowed emissions annually in this period, minus the emission reduction certificates that were taken into account during 2008-2012 but that were not required for meeting the operator’s 2008–2012 reduction obligations;  
|    b. for the remaining installation operators and greenhouse gas emissions: 4.5 per cent of the greenhouse gas emissions for 2013–2020;  
|    c. for installation operators that extend their reduction obligation under Article 31 paragraph 1[bis] of the CO2 Act until the end of 2021: 4.5 per cent of the greenhouse gas emissions for 2013–2021.

[2] The extent to which emission-reduction certificates are taken into account in accordance with paragraph 1 is as follows:


|    a. for an installation operator that was only intermittently subject to a reduction obligation in the years 2013–2020: correspondingly reduced for this time period;  
|    b. for an installation operator that, in comparison with 2012, produces additional electricity that is used outside the installation operator: increased by 50 per cent of the required increase in additional reduction performance;  
|    c. for an installation operator under paragraph 1 letter a, the emissions or measures target of which has been amended: increased or reduced in accordance with the amendment; the quantity of eligible emission-reduction certificates are thereby reduced to a maximum of 8 per cent of five times the average allowed emissions annually in this period, minus the emission-reduction certificates that were taken into account in the years 2008–2012.

[**Art. 76** Failure to meet reduction obligations and the investment obligation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_76)

[1] If an operator fails to meet its reduction obligation, then the FOEN shall impose a penalty in accordance with Article 32 of the CO2 Act.

[1bis] If a CHP plant operator fails to meet the investment obligation in accordance with Article 96*a* paragraph 2 or Article 98*a* paragraph 2, the FOEN shall order the repayment of 40 per cent of the refund paid for fuels used for electricity production in accordance with Article 32*a* of the CO2 Act.

[2] The payment deadline is 30 days from the entry of the ruling. If a payment is late, default interest at the rate of 5 per cent per year is charged.

[3] The amounts repaid in accordance with paragraph 1[bis] shall be deemed to be revenue from the CO2 levy.

[**Art. 77** Security for the penalty](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#art_77) 

If an installation operator is at risk of not meeting its target, then the FOEN may require security for the expected penalty until the risk no longer exists.

1.2 If no product benchmark applies, then the quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge annually is calculated based on the heat benchmark as follows:

62.3 emission allowances per TJ of measurable heat, whereby only measurable heat produced or measurable heat imported from other installations whose operators are participating in the ETS is eligible for allocation, provided that this heat is not produced from electricity, and


|    a. is used within the system boundaries of the installation operator participating in the ETS for manufacturing products, for generating mechanical energy other than that used to generate electricity, for heating or for cooling, but not to generate electricity; or  
|    b. is exported to third parties outside the ETS, with the exception of exports for generating electricity and transmitting imported heat.

1.3 If neither a product benchmark nor a heat benchmark applies, then the quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge annually is calculated on the basis on the following thermal-fuel benchmark:

56.1 emission allowances per TJ of energy input from thermal fuels.

1.4 If none of the benchmarks described in numbers 1.1–1.3 is applicable, then the quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge annually is calculated on the basis of 0.97 times process emissions.

1.5 For the use of gases that come from processes and contain a high proportion of partially oxidised carbon (residual gas), there is an additional free-of-charge allocation to compensate for higher CO2 emissions and lower efficiency in the use of residual gases in comparison with natural gas. This allocation is only made if the residual gas is created outside of a sub-installation with product benchmark and is used within the installation in the ETS to generate measurable or non-measurable heat or for the production of electricity.

1.6 No emission allowances are allocated free of charge for heat resulting from the manufacture of nitric acid.

1.7 If heat used within a sub-installation with product benchmark is imported from third parties outside the ETS, if the heat originates from the manufacture of nitric acid or if it is generated from electricity, the quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge that is calculated according to the product benchmark shall be reduced by this quantity of heat multiplied by the heat benchmark of 62.3 emission allowances per TJ.

### [2 General calculation of the quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#annex_9/lvl_d2451e320/lvl_2)

2.1 The quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge is calculated per sub-installation for each year of participation in the ETS, subject to numbers 4 and 5, according to the following formula:

*Allocation**i* *= BM * AR * AF**i* ** SKF**i*

Allocationi Allocation in year i

BM Benchmark

AR Activity rate (referring to the relevant benchmark)

AFi Adaptation factor in year i in accordance with Annex 9 no 3

SKFi Cross-sectoral correction factor in year i

2.2 The benchmark is determined per sub-installation on the basis of the benchmark hierarchy described in numbers 1.1–1.4.

2.3 The activity rate refers to the relevant benchmark (historical activity rate) and corresponds to the arithmetical mean of the annual values for the 2014–2018 period for the 2021–2025 allocation period and the arithmetical mean of the annual values in 2019–2023 period for the allocation period 2026–2030 allocation period.

2.4 In the absence of annual values for two full calendar years in the reference period in accordance with Number 2.3, the annual value for the first full calendar year after the relevant installations start operating corresponds to the historical activity rate. If the start of operations takes place after 1 January 2021, the quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge for the period between the start of operations and 31 December of the same year shall be calculated using the effective activity rate for this period.

### [3 Adaptation factors](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#annex_9/lvl_d2451e320/lvl_3)

3.1 For sectors and subsectors that are not listed in the Annex to Decision 2019/708/EU, the quantities calculated in accordance with numbers 2 and 4 are multiplied by the following adaptation factors:


|    3.1.1 for 2021: 0.3  
|    3.1.2 for 2022: 0.3  
|    3.1.3 for 2023: 0.3  
|    3.1.4 for 2024: 0.3  
|    3.1.5 for 2025: 0.3  
|    3.1.6 for 2026: 0.3  
|    3.1.7 for 2027: 0.225  
|    3.1.8 for 2028: 0.15  
|    3.1.9 for 2029: 0.075  
|    3.1.10 for 2030: 0

3.2 If an installation operator delivers heat to a third party, then the customer’s adaptation factor is decisive.

3.3 The adaptation factor for measurable heat amounts to 0.3 if it is distributed via a network and used for heating water, space heating or space cooling in buildings or at locations whose operator does not participate in the ETS,; the foregoing does not apply to measurable heat that is directly or indirectly used to manufacture products or generate electricity.

3.4 For the manufacture of niacin and installations whose main purpose is the disposal of special waste as defined in Article 3 letter c ADWO, the adaptation factor amounts to 1.

### [4 Special adaptation factors for thermal fuels and electricity operated production processes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/856/en#annex_9/lvl_d2451e320/lvl_4)

4.1 No emission allowances are allocated free of charge for indirect emissions from the use of electricity. For benchmarks of production processes that can be operated with either thermal fuels or electricity, the indirect emissions from electricity used are 0.376 t CO2 per MWh.

The quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge annually is calculated in these cases as follows:

*Allocation**i**= (E**direct**/ (E**direct* *+ E**indirect**)) * BM * AR * AF**i* ** SKF**i*

Allocationi Allocation in year i

Edirect Direct emissions from within the corresponding sub-installation with product benchmark in the reference period in accordance with Number 2. Emissions from heat used within or outside the sub-installation that was obtained directly from other ETS operators are also taken into account, at 62.3 t CO2 per TJ.

Eindirect Indirect emissions from the electricity used within the corresponding sub-installation with product benchmark in the reference period in number 2.

BM Benchmark

AR Activity rate (referring to the relevant benchmark)

AFi Adaptation factor in year i in accordance with Annex 9 no 3

SKFi Cross-sectoral correction factor in year i

The quantity of emission allowances is based on the following benchmark:

0.000642186914222035 emission allowances per tonne-kilometre

The maximum quantity of emission allowances for aircraft available as a whole in 2020 is calculated as follows:

Cap2020 = ∑tkmCH-ETS * BM * 100 / 82

Cap2020 Emissions cap for 2020

∑tkmCH-ETS Sum of tonne-kilometres in 2018 in the Swiss ETS 

BM Benchmark

The annually maximum available quantity of emission allowances for aircraft from 2021 shall be calculated as follows using the emissions cap for 2020 and the annual reduction factor of 2.2 per cent relative to 2020:

*Cap**202x**= Cap**2020* *– x * 0.022 * Cap**2020*

Cap202x emissions cap for 202x; where x = 1, 2, 3, etc.

The annually maximum available quantity of emission allowances is used as follows:

82 per cent are available for allocation free of charge to aircraft operators;

15 per cent is withheld for the auction;

3 per cent is withheld for new or fast-growing aircraft operators.

5. In 2020, the quantity of emission allowances that are withheld in accordance with Article 46e paragraph 3 letter c for 2020 shall be deleted.

6. The quantity of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge to an aircraft operator for 2020 is calculated according to the following formula:

Allocation = ∑tkmoperator * BM
