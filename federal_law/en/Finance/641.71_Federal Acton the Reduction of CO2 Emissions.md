# Federal Acton the Reduction of CO2 Emissions

## (CO2 Act)

of 23 December 2011 (Status as of 1 January 2021)

The Federal Assembly of the Swiss Confederation,

on the basis of Articles 74 and 89 of the Federal Constitution  
and having considered the Federal Council Dispatches dated 26 August 2009   
and 20 January 2010,

decrees:

# [Chapter 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#chap_1)

[**Art. 1** Aim](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_1) 

[1] This Act is intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and in particular CO2 emissions that are attributable to the use of fossil fuels (thermal and motor fuels) as energy sources with the aim of contributing to limiting the global rise in temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius.

[2] The Federal Council designates the greenhouse gases.

[**Art. 2** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_2) 

[1] Thermal fuels are fossil fuels used for the generation of heat, the production of light, the production of electricity in thermal facilities or the operation of combined heat and power plants (CHP plants).

[2] Motor fuels are fossil fuels used in combustion engines to produce power.

[3] Emission allowances are tradable rights to emit greenhouse gases allocated or auctioned by the Confederation or by states or communities of states with emissions trading schemes (ETS) recognised by the Federal Council.

[4] Emission reduction certificates are internationally recognised tradable documents attesting to reductions in emissions achieved abroad.

[5] Installations are fixed technical units at a single location.

[**Art. 3** Reduction target](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_3) 

[1] Domestic greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced overall by 20 per cent as compared with 1990 levels, by 2020. The Federal Council may set sector-specific interim targets.

[1bis] Domestic greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced in 2021 by a further 1.5 per cent compared with 1990 levels. The Federal Council may specify sectoral interim targets.

[2] The Federal Council may increase the reduction target to 40 per cent in order to comply with international agreements. A maximum of 75 per cent of the additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may be achieved through measures carried out abroad.

[3] The total volume of greenhouse gas emissions is calculated on the basis of the greenhouse gases emitted in Switzerland. Emissions from the use of aviation fuel on international flights are not taken into account.

[3bis] The Federal Council shall determine the extent to which emission allowances from states or communities of states with ETSs recognised by the Federal Council shall be taken into account in order to achieve the reduction target in accordance with paragraph 1.

[4] The Federal Council may set reduction targets for individual economic sectors by agreement with the parties concerned.

[5] It shall at the due time submit proposals to the Federal Assembly on the reduction targets for the period after 2020. It shall consult the parties concerned beforehand.

[**Art. 4** Measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_4) 

[1] The reduction target should in the first instance be achieved through measures under this Act.

[2] Measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with other legislation should also contribute to achieving the reduction target. These measures in particular include those in the fields of environment and energy, agriculture, forestry and timber industry, road traffic and the taxation of mineral oil, as well as voluntary measures.

[3] Voluntary measures also include undertakings by consumers of fossil thermal and motor fuels voluntarily to limit their CO2 emissions.

[4] The Federal Council may assign suitable organisations to support and carry out voluntary measures.

[**Art. 5** Counting emission reductions achieved abroad](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_5) 

The Federal Council may take appropriate account of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that have been achieved abroad when calculating emissions under this Act. 

[**Art. 6** Quality requirements for reductions in emissions abroad](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_6) 

[1] The Federal Council specifies quality requirements for measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions carried out abroad. Measures that do not meet these requirements are not considered emission reductions.

[2] The quality requirements must satisfy the following quality criteria in particular:


|    a. reductions may only be counted if they would not have been achieved without support from Switzerland;  
|    b. reductions in developing countries must contribute to sustainable development in those countries and must not have negative social or ecological impacts.

[**Art.7** Attestations for domestic emission reductions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_7) 

[1] The Federal Council or the competent department issues documents attesting reductions in greenhouse gas emissions achieved voluntarily in Switzerland.

[2] It specifies the extent to which these attestations are considered equivalent to emission allowances or emission reduction certificates.

[**Art. 8** Coordination of adaptation measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_8) 

[1] The Confederation coordinates the measures to avoid or deal with the harm to persons or damage to property of substantial value that may be caused by the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

[2] It is responsible for devising and obtaining the basic knowledge necessary for these measures.

# [Chapter 2 Technical Measures to reduce CO2 Emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#chap_2)

## [Section 1 Buildings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#chap_2/sec_1)

[**Art. 9**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_9) 

[1] The cantons ensure that the CO2 emissions from buildings that are heated with fossil fuels are reduced in compliance with the targets. Accordingly, they issue building standards for new and older buildings based on the current state of the art.

[2] The cantons submit a report each year to the Confederation on the measures taken.

## [Section 2](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#chap_2/sec_2) [Passenger Cars, Vans and Light Articulated Vehicles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#chap_2/sec_2)

[**Art. 10** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_10) 

[1] The CO2 emissions from passenger cars that are registered for the first time must be reduced to an average of 130 g CO2/km by the end of 2015 and to an average of 95 g CO2/km by the end of 2020.

[2] The CO2 emissions from vans and articulated vehicles with a total weight of no more than 3.50 t (light articulated vehicles) that are registered for the first time must be reduced to an average of 147 g CO2/km by the end of 2020.

[3] For this purpose, any importer or manufacturer of vehicles under paragraphs 1 and 2 (referred to below as “vehicles”) must reduce the average CO2 emissions of the vehicles that it imports into or manufactures in Switzerland that are registered for the first time in the reference year in accordance with its individual target (Art. 11).

[4] The targets in paragraphs 1 and 2 are based on the current customary measurement methods. In the event of a change in the measurement methods, the Federal Council shall specify in the implementing provisions the targets that correspond to the targets in these paragraphs. It shall indicate the applicable measurement methods, taking account of the European Union regulations.

[**Art. 10***a* Interim targets, facilitations and exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_10_a) 

[1] The Federal Council may specify binding interim targets in addition to the target values under Article 10.

[2] It may issue special provisions on the transition to new targets that facilitate the meeting of targets for a limited period.

[3] It may exclude certain vehicles from the scope of the regulations on reducing CO2 emissions.

[4] In doing so, it shall take account of the regulations of the European Union.

[**Art.****10***b* Reporting and proposals for a further reduction of CO2 emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_10_b) 

[1] The Federal Council shall submit a report to the Federal Assembly for the first time in 2016 and every three years thereafter on the extent to which the targets specified in Article 10 and the interim targets under Article 10*a* paragraph 1 have been met.

[2] It shall at the due time submit to the Federal Assembly proposals for a further reduction in CO2 emissions from vehicles for the period after 2020. In doing so, it shall take account of the regulations of the European Union.

[**Art. 11** Individual target](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_11) 

1 The Federal Council shall establish a method for calculating the individual target for each importer or manufacturer of vehicles. The calculation relates to the vehicles of the importer or manufacturer first registered in the reference year (the new vehicle fleet). Passenger cars on the one hand and vans and light articulated vehicles on the other each constitute their own new vehicle fleet.

2 In determining the calculation method, the Federal Council shall take account of the following in particular:


|    a. the properties of the vehicles imported into or manufactured in Switzerland such as unladen weight, pan area or ecological innovations;  
|    b. the regulations of the European Union.

3 Importers and manufacturers may agree to form emissions pools. The same rights and obligations apply to each emissions pool as for each importer or manufacturer.

4 Where an importer or manufacturer registers for the first time in any year no more than 49 passenger cars or, where applicable, no more than five vans or light articulated vehicles of the vehicles that it imports into or manufactures in Switzerland, the individual targets are determined for each vehicle on the basis of the calculation method specified in paragraph 1.

[**Art. 12** Calculation of the individual target and the average CO2 emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_12) 

1 At the end of each year, the Swiss Federal Office of Energy shall calculate for each importer or manufacturer:


|    a. the individual target;  
|    b. the average CO2 emissions of the relevant new vehicle fleet.

2 The Federal Council shall specify the data that importers or manufacturers must provide for the calculations specified in paragraph 1 for vehicles with no type approval. It may set a flat rate emission value for the calculation specified in paragraph 1 letter b if the data is not submitted by a certain deadline.

3 The Federal Council may specify the extent to which special account may be taken of vehicles with very low CO2 emissions when making the calculation specified in paragraph 1 letter b.

[**Art. 13** Penalty for exceeding the individual target](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_13) 

1 If the average CO2 emissions from the new vehicle fleet of an importer or manufacturer exceed the individual target, the manufacturer or the importer must pay the Confederation the following amounts for each vehicle registered for the first time in the relevant calendar year:


|    a. for 2013–2018:

for the first gram of CO2/km over the individual target: between 5.00 and 8.00 francs,

for the second gram of CO2/km over the individual target: between 15.00 and 24.00 francs,

for the third gram of CO2/km over the individual target: between 25.00 and 40.00 francs,

for the fourth and every further gram of CO2/km over the individual target: between 95.00 and 152.00 francs;


|    b. from 1 January 2019: for each gram of CO2/km over the individual target between 95.00 and 152.00 francs.

[2] The amounts in paragraph 1 shall be re-calculated each year. The Federal Council shall regulate the method used for their calculation. It shall base its decision on the amounts applied in the European Union and the exchange rate. The calculation and publication of the amounts is carried out before the start of the year concerned by the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications.

[3] For importers and manufacturers under Article 11 paragraph 4, the amounts in paragraphs 1 and 2 apply to each individual vehicle whose CO2 emissions exceed the individual target. If certain provisions issued in accordance with Article 10*a* lead to a situation where importers and manufacturers under Article 11 paragraph 4 are prejudiced in comparison with other importers or manufacturers because of the special rules that apply to them on calculating the target, the Federal Council may reduce the sanction for those affected.

4 The members of emissions pools are jointly and severally liable.

5 In addition, Articles 10 and 11 of the Mineral Oil Tax Act of 21 June 1996 apply by analogy. 

6 The Federal Council may provide that the sales documentation for vehicles indicates the amount which would have to be paid in accordance with paragraphs 1–3 if the sanction were fixed on the basis of the CO2 emissions of the individual vehicle.

[1] The Federal Council shall determine in advance the quantity of emission allowances for installations and the quantity of emission allowances for aircraft to be made available each year; in doing so, it shall give due consideration to the reduction target in accordance with Article 3 and comparable international arrangements.

[2] It may adjust the available quantity of emission allowances if it designates new categories of installation in accordance with Article 16 paragraph 3, retrospectively exempts categories of installation from the requirement to participate in the ETS, or if comparable international arrangements are modified.

[3] It shall retain an appropriate quantity of emission allowances each year for installations and for aircraft in order to make these available to future ETS participants and fast-growing ETS participants.

[**Art. 19**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_19) [Issuing emission allowances for installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/855/en#art_19) 

[1] The emission allowances for installations are issued annually.

[2] Some of the emission allowances are allocated free of charge. The other emission allowances are auctioned.

[3] The quantity of emission allowances allocated free of charge to an installation operator is determined in particular by the greenhouse gas efficiency of reference installations.

[4] Installation operators shall not be allocated emission allowances free of charge for the production of electricity. The Federal Council may provide for exceptions.

[5] If the quantity of emission allowances available on the market increases considerably for economic reasons, the Federal Council may stipulate that only some of the remaining emission allowances be auctioned. The emission allowances that are not offered for auction and those that are not sold at auction shall be cancelled.
