(Art. 3 let. a VAT Act)

Swiss ocean-going ships do not qualify as territory of the Swiss Confederation for the purposes of Article 3 letter a VAT Act.

[**Art. 2** Pledge and special terms of sale](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_2) 

(Art. 3 let. d VAT Act)

[1] The sale of goods represents a supply of goods even if a reservation of title is recorded.

[2] The transfer of ownership of goods as security or as a pledge does not represent a supply of goods. If the right under the transfer of ownership as security or under the pledge is enforced, a supply of goods takes place.

[3] A sale of goods with simultaneous leaseback to the seller for use (sale and leaseback business) does not qualify as a supply of goods if at the time of the conclusion of the contract a re-transfer is agreed. In this case the service of the lessor does not qualify as making goods available for use, but as a financing service under Article 21 paragraph 2 number 19 letter a VAT Act.

[**Art. 3** Declaration of subjection on import of goods](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_3) 

(Art. 7 para. 3 let. a VAT Act)

1 ...

2 If the import is made in the supplier’s own name based on a declaration of subjection, for serial transactions the prior supplies of goods are deemed to be made abroad and the subsequent supplies on Swiss territory.

3 If the supplier does not intend to import in its own name, it must disclose this on the customer’s invoice.

[**Art. 4**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_4) [Supply of goods from abroad onto Swiss territory from a warehouse on Swiss territory](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_4) 

(Art. 7 para. 1 VAT Act)

In relation to goods that have been moved from abroad into a warehouse on Swiss territory and are delivered from this warehouse, the place of supply is located abroad if the recipient of the supply and the consideration to be paid are known at the time the goods are moved onto Swiss territory and the goods are released for free circulation at the time of supply.

[**Art. 4***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_4_a) [Time of change in the place of supply in respect of mail-order supplies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_4_a) 

(Art. 7 para. 3 let. b VAT Act) 

1 Where goods supplied from abroad onto Swiss territory are exempt from import tax because of the negligible amount of tax due, the place of supply is deemed to be abroad until the end of the month in which the supplier reaches the turnover threshold of 100 000 francs from such supplies. 

2 From the following month the place of supply for all supplies made by the supplier from abroad onto Swiss territory is deemed to be on Swiss territory. From this time, the supplier must import the goods in its own name.

3 The place of supply remains on Swiss territory until the end of any calendar year in which the supplier fails to reach the turnover threshold of 100 000 francs from supplies in accordance with paragraph 1. 

4 If the supplier fails to reach the turnover threshold but does not notify the FTA of this fact in writing, the supplier is deemed to be subject to the VAT Act in accordance with Article 7 paragraph 3 letter a.

[1] If supplies under Article 8 paragraph 2 letters c and d VAT Act are made while transporting passengers in border areas that are partly on Swiss territory and partly abroad or are on Lake Constance, and if the place of supply cannot be clearly determined as being on Swiss territory or abroad, the supply is deemed to be made at the place where the person making the supply has its place of business, or a permanent establishment or, in the absence of such a place of business or such a permanent establishment, its domicile or the place from which it works.

[2] If the taxable person proves that a supply under paragraph 1 was made abroad, Article 8 paragraph 2 letters c and d VAT Act applies.

If it is not yet possible at the time to assess whether the turnover threshold will be achieved, a re-assessment must be carried out within three months at the latest.

[2] Where it must be assumed based on the re-assessment that the turnover threshold will be achieved, the exemption from tax liability ends either:


|    a. on the date of commencement or expansion of the activity; or  
|    b. on the date of the re-assessment, but at the latest at the beginning of the fourth month.

(Art. 24 para. 1 VAT Act)

1 For purposes of calculating the VAT payable, considerations paid in foreign currency must be converted into national currency at the date the tax claim arises.

2 A consideration is in foreign currency if the invoice or the receipt is issued in foreign currency. If no invoice or receipt is issued, the book entry of the supplier applies. It is irrelevant whether the payment is in national or foreign currency and in which currency the change is paid.

3 The conversion is made on the basis of the rate of exchange published by the FTA, whereby the taxable person may elect to use the average monthly rate or the daily exchange rate.

[3bis] Where the FTA does not publish an exchange rate for a foreign currency, the daily exchange rate for the sale of the foreign currency published by a Swiss bank applies.

4 Taxable persons that are members of a group of companies may use the group conversion rate for their conversion. This rate must be applied both to supplies within the group of companies and in relation to third parties.

5 The procedure chosen (monthly average, daily or group rates) must be retained for at least one tax period.

1 On supplies to employees for consideration, the tax must be calculated on the consideration actually received. Article 24 paragraphs 2 and 3 VAT Act is reserved.

2 Supplies made by the employer to employees which must be declared in the salary certificate are deemed to be made with consideration. The tax must be calculated on the amount that is also applicable for direct taxes.

3 Supplies which do not have to be declared in the salary certificate constitute supplies made without consideration and it is assumed that a business reason exists.

4 Where lump sums that are permissible for determining the wage elements applicable for direct tax purposes may also serve to assess the VAT, they may also be used for VAT purposes.

5 When applying paragraphs 2–4, it is irrelevant whether the persons concerned are closely related persons as stipulated under Article 3 letter h VAT Act.

[**Art. 48** Cantonal contributions to water, sewage or waste funds](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_48)

2 Adequate is any use of one or more methods that takes account of the principle of efficiency of imposition, is auditable economically and allocates the input taxes according to their use for a particular activity.

### [Section 4 Own Use](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#tit_2/chap_5/sec_4)

[**Art. 69** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_69) 

(Art. 31 VAT Act)

1 The input tax deduction must be corrected in full on goods and services not put to use.

2 The input tax deduction must be corrected on goods and services put to use that are still available at the time the requirements are no longer fulfilled and have a fair value. In the case of supply of services in the fields of consulting, accounting, staff recruitment, management and advertising, it is assumed they are exhausted at the time of their acquisition and are no longer available.

3 In the case of self-manufactured goods, for putting the infrastructure to use, a flat rate surcharge of 33 per cent must be made on the input taxes on materials and on any third party work on semi-finished goods. Alternatively, effective proof of the input taxes applicable to the use of the infrastructure may be provided.

4 If subsequently the requirements for the input tax deduction are only partially fulfilled, the correction must be made to the extent that the use no longer entitles the input tax deduction to be made.

[**Art. 70** Determination of the fair value](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_70) 

(Art. 31 para. 3 VAT Act)

1 The fair value must be calculated on the basis of the acquisition cost, for real estate excluding the value of the land and of value enhancing expenditures. Not to be considered are, however, the value maintenance expenditures. Value maintenance expenditures are those that serve only to maintain the value of the good and its ability to function, in particular service, maintenance, operating and repair costs.

2 In determining the fair value of goods and services put to use, in the first tax period of use the loss in value must be considered for the entire tax period. In the last uncompleted tax period, on the other hand, no depreciation may be made unless the change in use occurs on the last day of the tax period.

[**Art. 71** Major immovable property renovations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_71) 

(Art. 31 VAT Act)

If the renovation costs in a construction phase exceed in total 5 per cent of the insurance value of the building prior to renovation, the input tax deduction must be corrected on the basis of the total costs, regardless of whether the costs are for value enhancing or maintenance expenditures.

### [Section 5 Subsequent Input Tax Deduction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#tit_2/chap_5/sec_5)

[**Art. 72** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_72) 

(Art. 32 VAT Act)

1 The input tax deduction may be corrected in full on goods and services not put to use.

2 The input tax deduction may be corrected on goods and services put to use which still exist and have a fair value at the time the requirements for the input tax deduction are fulfilled. For services in the fields of consulting, accounting, staff recruitment, management and advertising, it is assumed that they are used on acquisition and thereafter cease to exist.

3 In the case of self-manufactured goods, for putting the infrastructure to use, a flat rate surcharge of 33 per cent may be made on the input taxes on materials and on any third party work on semi-finished goods. Alternatively, effective proof of input taxes applicable to the use of the infrastructure may be provided.

4 If subsequently the requirements for the input tax deduction are only partially fulfilled, the correction may be made only to the extent of the use entitling the input tax deduction to be made.

[**Art. 73** Determination of the fair value](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_73) 

(Art. 32 para. 2 VAT Act)

1 The fair value must be calculated on the basis of the acquisition cost, for real estate excluding the value of the land and of value enhancing expenditures. Not to be considered are, however, the value maintenance expenditures. Value maintenance expenditures are those that serve only to maintain the value of the good and its ability to function, in particular service, maintenance, operating and repair costs.

2 In determining the fair value of goods and services put to use, in the first tax period of use the loss in value must be considered for the entire tax period. In the last uncompleted tax period, on the other hand, no depreciation must be made unless the change in use occurs on the last day of the tax period.

[**Art. 74** Major renovations of immovable property](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_74) 

(Art. 32 VAT Act)

If the renovation costs in a construction phase exceed in total 5 per cent of the insurance value of the building prior to renovation, the entire input tax deduction may be corrected on the basis of the total costs, regardless of whether the costs are for value enhancing or maintenance expenditures.

### [Section 6 Reduction of the Input Tax Deduction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#tit_2/chap_5/sec_6)

(Art. 33 para. 2 VAT Act)

[**Art. 75**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_75) 

1 The input tax need not be reduced if the funds under Article 18 paragraph 2 letters a–c VAT Act are attributable to a business activity for which no input tax is incurred or for which no claim to input tax deduction exists.

2 To the extent the funds under Article 18 paragraph 2 letters a–c VAT Act can be attributed to a specific business activity, only the input tax on the expenditures for this business activity must be reduced.

3 If the funds under Article 18 paragraph 2 letters a–c VAT Act are paid to cover an operating deficit, the input tax must be reduced overall in the proportion of these funds to the total turnover, excluding VAT.

[**Art. 77** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_77) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 The taxable supplies made for consideration on Swiss territory must be considered in assessing whether the conditions under Article 37 VAT Act are fulfilled.

2 The net tax rate method may not be chosen by taxable persons who:


|    a. may report using the flat tax rate method under Article 37 paragraph 5 VAT Act;  
|    b. use the movement procedure under Article 63 VAT Act;  
|    c. use group taxation under Article 13 VAT Act;  
|    d. have their place of business or a permanent establishment in the valley areas of Samnaun or Sampuoir;  
|    e. generate more than 50 per cent of their turnovers from taxable supplies to another taxable person who reports using the effective method where the persons involved are under the same management;  
|    f. make supplies on Swiss territory based on Article 7 paragraph 3 VAT Act.

3 Taxable persons who report using the net tax rate method may not opt for the taxation of supplies under Article 21 paragraph 2 numbers 1–24, 27, 29 and 30 VAT Act. If the tax is nevertheless invoiced, the tax charged must be paid to the FTA with reservation of Article 27 paragraph 2 VAT Act.

[**Art. 78** Submission to the net tax rate method on commencement of tax liability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_78) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 Persons newly entered in the Register of Taxable Persons (VAT Register) who wish to submit to the net tax rate method must notify the FTA in writing within 60 days of notification of their VAT number.

2 The FTA shall approve the use of the net tax rate method if in the first 12 months both the expected turnover and the expected taxes do not exceed the thresholds in Article 37 paragraph 1 VAT Act.

3 If no request is made within the period in paragraph 1, the taxable person must report for at least three years using the effective reporting method before it may submit to the net tax rate method. An earlier change of the reporting method is possible at the time of any adjustment to the net tax rate that is not due to a change in the rates of taxation under Articles 25 and 55 VAT Act.

4 Paragraphs 1–3 also apply to retroactive entries analogously.

5 The VAT chargeable on the stock of goods, the operating material and the fixed assets at the start of tax liability is taken into account in applying the net tax rate method. No subsequent input tax deduction may be made.

[**Art. 79** Change from the effective reporting method to the net tax rate method](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_79) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 Taxable persons who wish to change from the effective reporting method to the net tax rate method must notify the FTA in writing at the latest 60 days after the beginning of the tax period from which the change is to be made. If the notification is late, the change is effective for the beginning of the subsequent tax period.

2 The FTA shall approve the use of the net tax rate method if in the prior tax period neither of the thresholds in Article 37 paragraph 1 VAT Act was exceeded.

3 On changing from the effective reporting method to the net tax rate method, no corrections or changes shall be made to the stock of goods, the operating material and the fixed assets. The foregoing does not apply to a correction under Article 93 where immovable goods are used after the change to a negligible extent for an activity entitling the input tax deduction to be made.

4 If simultaneously with submission to the net tax rate method the manner of reporting under Article 39 VAT Act is also changed, the following corrections must be made:


|    a. if a change is made from agreed to collected considerations, the FTA shall credit the taxable person the tax at the appropriate statutory tax rate on the taxable supplies invoiced but not yet paid on the date of change (debtor items) and at the same time charge the input tax on the taxable supplies invoiced to it, but not yet paid (creditor items);  
|    b. if a change is made from collected to agreed considerations, the FTA shall charge the tax on the debtor items existing on the date of change at the appropriate statutory tax rate and at the same time credit the input tax on the creditor items.

[**Art. 80** Withdrawal of approval](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_80) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

The FTA may retroactively withdraw approval to use this reporting method from taxable persons who have been permitted to use the net tax rate method on the basis of false information.

[**Art. 81** Change from the net tax rate method to the effective reporting method](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_81) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 Taxable persons who wish to change from the net tax rate method to the effective method must notify the FTA in writing at the latest 60 days before the beginning of the tax period from which the change is to be made. If the request is late, the change is effective from the beginning of the subsequent tax period.

2 Persons who exceed one or both thresholds laid down in Article 37 paragraph 1 VAT Act in two consecutive tax periods by up to 50 per cent must change to the effective reporting method at the beginning of the following tax period.

3 Persons who exceed one or both thresholds laid down in Article 37 paragraph 1 VAT Act by more than 50 per cent must change to the effective reporting method at the beginning of the following tax period. If the thresholds are exceeded in the first 12 months of submission to the net tax rate method, approval is withdrawn retroactively.

4 If one or both thresholds are exceeded by more than 50 per cent due to the takeover of all or part of the assets under the notification procedure, the taxable person may decide whether it wishes to change to the effective reporting method retroactively to the beginning of the tax period in which the takeover took place or at the beginning of the subsequent tax period.

5 On change from the net tax rate method to the effective reporting method, there are no corrections to the stock of goods, the operating material and the fixed assets. The foregoing does not apply to a subsequent input tax deduction under Article 32 VAT Act if the stock of goods, the operating material and the fixed assets are used to a greater extent after the change for an activity entitling the input tax deduction to be made.

6 If at the same time as the change to the effective reporting method the manner of reporting under Article 39 VAT Act is also changed, the following corrections must be made:


|    a. if a change is made from agreed to collected considerations, the FTA shall credit the taxable person with the tax on the debtor items existing at the date of change at the approved net tax rates. No corrections are made to the creditor items;  
|    b. if a change is made from collected to agreed considerations, the FTA shall charge the tax on the debtor items existing at the date of the change at the approved net tax rates. No corrections are made to the creditor items.

[**Art. 82** End of tax liability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_82) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 If a taxable person reporting under the net tax rate method ceases its business activities or if, due to failing to reach the turnover threshold in Article 10 paragraph 2 letter a VAT Act, it is exempt from tax liability, the turnovers generated prior to being removed from the VAT Register, the work in progress and, if reporting according to collected considerations, the debtor items are also to be reported at the approved net tax rates.

2 On the date of removal from the VAT Register, the tax must be reported on the fair value of immoveable goods at the standard rate applicable at that time, provided:


|    a. the good was purchased, constructed or converted by the taxable person when it used the effective method and it has claimed the input tax deduction;  
|    b. the good was purchased by the taxable person under the notification procedure from a taxable person reporting using the effective method.

3 In determining the fair value of immovable goods, for every year expired one twentieth is reduced on a straight line basis.

[**Art. 83** Takeover of assets under the notification procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_83) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 If, from the date of the takeover, a taxable person reporting under the net tax rate method does not use all or part of the assets taken over using the notification procedure under Article 38 VAT Act or uses such assets only to a lesser extent than the seller of a business entitled to deduct input tax, the procedure is as follows:


|    a. if the seller reports under the net tax rate method, no corrections are made;  
|    b. if the seller reports under the effective method, on that part of the assets taken over which is used in future for a business activity not entitling him to deduct the input tax, own use within the meaning of Article 31 VAT Act must be reported taking into consideration Article 38 paragraph 4 VAT Act.

2 If a taxable person reporting under the net tax rate method uses all or part of the assets taken over using the notification procedure under Article 38 VAT Act to a greater extent than the seller for a business activity entitling him to deduct the input tax, a correction is not permitted.

[**Art. 84** Reporting using net tax rates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_84) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 Taxable persons must report their business activities at the net tax rates approved by the FTA.

2 If a business activity ceases or a new business activity is begun or if the turnover shares of the business activities change in such a way that a new allocation of the net tax rates becomes necessary, the taxable person must contact the FTA.

3 Taxable persons for whom two different net tax rates have been approved must record the revenues for each of the net tax rates separately.

[**Art. 85** Approval of the use of a single net tax rate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_85) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

The taxable person is permitted to use a single net tax rate unless a case under Article 86 paragraph 1 or Article 89 paragraphs 3 or 5 applies.

[**Art. 86** Approval of the use of two net tax rates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_86) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 The taxable person is permitted to use two net tax rates if:


|    a. it carries on two or more business activities for which the net tax rates laid down by the FTA differ; and  
|    b. at least two of these business activities each has a share of more than 10 per cent of the total turnover from taxable supplies.

2 The 10 per cent threshold is calculated:


|    a. for persons who become newly taxable and for taxable persons who take up a new business activity: based on the expected turnovers;  
|    b. for the other taxable persons: based on the turnover of the two preceding tax periods.

3 The turnovers of business activities with the same net tax rate must be accumulated in investigating whether the 10 per cent threshold is exceeded.

4 In the case of a taxable person who has been permitted the use of two net tax rates, if only one or more business activities for which the same net tax rate is provided exceed the 10 per cent threshold during two consecutive tax periods, the approval for the use of the second net tax rate lapses at the beginning of the third tax period.

[**Art. 87** Level of the approved net tax rates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_87) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 If only two of the taxable person’s business activities exceed the 10 per cent threshold, the use of the two net tax rates laid down for these businesses will be approved.

2 If more than two business activities exceed the 10 per cent threshold, use of the following net tax rates is approved:


|    a. the highest of the net tax rates that are laid down for the business activities whose share in the total turnover is more than 10 per cent;  
|    b. a second net tax rate which the taxable person selects from those tax rates that are laid down for the other business activities whose share in the total turnover is more than 10 per cent.

[**Art. 88** Taxation of the individual business activities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_88) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 The turnovers from the business activities of a taxable person who has been permitted the use of two net tax rates are taxable:


|    a. at the higher approved net tax rate if the net tax rate laid down for the business activity in question lies above the lower approved rate;  
|    b. at the lower approved rate in the other cases.  
|    [2] In cases under Article 19 paragraph 2 VAT Act, the entire consideration may be reported at the approved net rate tax applicable to the majority of the supply. However, if the supplies are all subject to the same tax rate under Article 25 VAT Act, the entire consideration must be reported at the higher approved net rate tax unless the taxable person can show which parts of the consideration apply to the individual supplies. 

[**Art. 89** Special rule for mixed branches of the industry](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_89) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 Mixed branches of the industry are branches of the industry in which several business activities are normally carried on which, if considered separately, would be reported using different net tax rates.

2 The FTA shall lay down in an ordinance:


|    a. the net tax rate applicable to each mixed branch of the industry;  
|    b. the usual main and ancillary business activities in the mixed branch of the industry.

3 Articles 86–88 apply to reporting using net tax rates if the share of one or more business activities usually ancillary to a branch of the industry for which under the FTA’s ordinance the same net tax rate would apply exceed 50 per cent of the turnover of the taxable main business and the taxable business usually ancillary to an industry.

4 The 50 per cent threshold is calculated:


|    a. for persons who become newly taxable and for taxable persons, who take up a new business: based on the expected turnovers;  
|    b. for the other taxable persons: based on the turnover in the two preceding tax periods.

5 If a taxable person who operates in a mixed branch of the industry also carries on business activities that are alien to the branch of the industry, reporting using net tax rates for these business activities is governed by Articles 86–88.

[**Art. 90** Special procedures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_90) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 The FTA shall make a procedure for the approximate compensation of the input taxes incurred available to taxable persons reporting using the net tax rate method for:


|    a. supplies of goods abroad, if the goods are self-manufactured or purchased with VAT being charged;  
|    b. supplies to beneficiaries under Article 2 of the Host State Act of 22 June 2007 (HSA), provided the place of supply lies on Swiss territory and for supplies of goods that the goods are self-manufactured or purchased with VAT being charged.

2 Taxable persons reporting using the net tax rate method who purchase individualisable moveable goods without openly transferred tax may use the procedure made available by the FTA to compensate the notional input tax. The procedure does not apply to used automobiles with an overall weight not exceeding 3,500 kg or to goods:


|    a. that the taxable person has accepted under the notification procedure from a person reporting using the effective method;   
|    b. that the taxable person knows or should have known were imported exempt from the tax;  
|    c. that the taxable person acquired exempt from the tax on Swiss territory; or  
|    d. that the taxable person accepted as part of a claim settlement, provided the payments made exceed the actual value of the good at the time of acceptance.

[2bis] The procedure under paragraph 2 applies in an analogous manner when collectors’ items (Art. 48*a*) are sold.

3 For businesses and events under Article 55 paragraph 3, the FTA provides for a flat rate arrangement for the approximate division of the turnovers between the two net tax rates.

[**Art. 91** Reporting of the acquisition tax](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_91) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

Taxable persons reporting using the net tax rate method who acquire supplies from businesses with their place of business abroad under Articles 45–49 VAT Act, must pay the acquisition tax semi-annually at the appropriate statutory tax rate.

[**Art. 92** Own use](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_92) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

Own use, with the exception of Article 83 paragraph 1 letter b, is taken into account in applying the net tax rate method.

[**Art. 93** Corrections of immovable goods](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_93) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 If an immovable good is no longer used in the business activities of the taxable person or is used newly for a business activity exempted from the tax without credit under Article 21 paragraph 2 VAT Act, the tax must be charged on the fair value at the standard rate at that time provided:


|    a. the good was purchased, constructed or converted by the taxable person when the person used the effective reporting method and claimed the input tax deduction;  
|    b. the good was purchased by the taxable person under the notification procedure from a taxable person applying the effective reporting method.

2 To determine the fair value of the immovable goods, for every completed year the value is reduced by one twentieth on a straight line basis.

[**Art. 94** Supplies to closely related persons and employees](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_94) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

1 Supplies to closely related persons are, subject to Article 93, reported as follows when reporting using net tax rates:


|    a. and b. ...  
|    c. goods and services are reported using the approved net tax rate at a value equal to the consideration paid, but at least at the amount that would be agreed between independent third parties;  
|    d. if reporting is done using two net tax rates and the supply cannot be allocated to a business activity, the higher rate is used.

2 Using net tax rates for reporting, supplies to employees are treated as follows:


|    a. goods given and services supplied for consideration to employees are reported at the approved net tax rate;  
|    b. if reporting is done using two net tax rates and the supply cannot be allocated to a business activity, the higher rate is used.

3 For closely related persons who are also employees, paragraph 2 applies.

4 Supplies that must be included in the salary certificate for direct tax purposes always constitute supplies for consideration. The tax must be calculated on the amount that is also applicable for direct tax purposes.

[**Art. 95**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_95) [Sales of equipment and fixed assets](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_95) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

Sales of equipment and fixed assets that are not used exclusively to provide supplies that are exempt from the tax without credit must be reported at the approved net tax rate. If reporting is done using two net tax rates and the equipment or the fixed assets were used for both business activities, the considerations must be reported at the higher net tax rate.

[**Art. 96** Invoicing at an excessive tax rate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_96) 

(Art. 37 para. 1–4 VAT Act)

If a taxable person reporting using net tax rates invoices a supply at an excessive tax rate, the person must, in addition to the VAT calculated at the net tax rate, also pay the difference between the tax calculated using the tax rate disclosed and the tax calculated using the tax rate under Article 25 VAT Act. The consideration is regarded as including VAT.

(Art. 37 para. 5 VAT Act)

1 Related institutions under Article 37 paragraph 5 VAT Act are in particular communal associations and other combinations of public authorities, parishes, private schools and boarding schools, private hospitals, medical treatment centres, rehabilitation centres, sanatoria, private home care organisations, old people’s homes, nursing homes, seniors residences, charitable businesses, such as disabled workshops, hostels and special schools, operators of sports facilities and cultural centres subsidised by public authorities, cantonal building insurers, water cooperatives, public transport businesses, private law forest corporations subsidised by public authorities, organisers of non-recurring cultural and sports events, associations under Articles 60–79 of the Civil Code (CC) and foundations under Articles 80–89bis CC.

3 Taxable persons who report using the flat tax rate method may not opt for the taxation of supplies under Article 21 paragraph 2 numbers 1–25, 27 and 29 VAT Act. If the tax is nevertheless invoiced, the tax charge must be paid to the FTA with reservation of Article 27 paragraph 2 VAT Act.

[4] Autonomous agencies under Article 12 paragraph 1 VAT Act that merge to form a single taxable entity (Art. 12 para. 2 VAT Act) may apply the flat rate tax method.

[**Art. 98** Submission to the flat tax rate method and change of the reporting method](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_98) 

(Art. 37 para. 5 VAT Act)

1 Public authorities and related institutions under Article 97 paragraph 1 which wish to report using the flat tax rate method must notify the FTA in writing.

2 The flat tax rate method must be retained for at least three tax periods. If the taxable person elects for the effective reporting method, the person may change to the flat tax rate method at the earliest after ten years. An earlier change of the reporting method is possible at the time of any adjustment to the flat tax rate that is not due to a change in the rates of taxation under Articles 25 and 55 VAT Act.

3 Changes to the reporting method are possible at the beginning of a tax period. They must be notified to the FTA in writing at the latest 60 days after the beginning of the tax period from which the change is to be made. If the notification is late, the change is effective at the beginning of the subsequent tax period.

[**Art. 99** Flat tax rate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_99) 

(Art. 37 para. 5 VAT Act)

1 When using the flat tax rate method, the tax claim is determined by multiplying the total of the considerations generated in a reporting period, including tax, by the flat tax rate approved by the FTA.

2 The FTA establishes the flat tax rates taking account of the input tax amounts usual in the relevant branch of the industry. A business activity for which no flat tax rate has been established must be reported at the rate applicable for the net tax rate method.

3 The taxable person must report each of its business activities with the appropriate flat tax rate. The number of applicable flat tax rates is not limited.

(Art. 107 para. 1 let. a VAT Act)

1 Institutional and individual beneficiaries are entitled to claim relief from VAT.

2 Institutional beneficiaries are:


|    a. beneficiaries under Article 2 paragraph 1 HSA who are exempt from the indirect taxes in accordance with public international law, an agreement concluded with the Federal Council for exemption from the indirect taxes or a decision of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) under Article 26 paragraph 3 HSA;  
|    b. beneficiaries under Article 2 paragraph 1 HSA domiciled abroad, to the extent they are exempt from the indirect taxes in accordance with their foundation deeds, a protocol concerning the privileges and immunities or other public international law agreements.

3 Individual beneficiaries are:


|    a. heads of state and government while actually exercising an official function on Swiss territory and persons in their entourage who enjoy diplomatic status;  
|    b. diplomatic representatives, consular officials, and persons in their entourage, provided they enjoy the same diplomatic status as the former on Swiss territory;  
|    c. high officials of institutional beneficiaries under paragraph 2 letter a who enjoy diplomatic status and the persons in their entourage, to the extent they enjoy the same diplomatic status on Swiss territory provided they are exempt from indirect taxes on the basis of an agreement between the Federal Council or the FDFA and the institutional beneficiaries in question or on the basis of a unilateral decision of the Federal Council or of the FDFA;  
|    d. delegates to international conferences, who enjoy diplomatic status, if the international conference they are attending is itself exempt from the indirect taxes in accordance with paragraph 2 letter a;  
|    e. persons carrying out an international mandate under Article 2 paragraph 2 letter b HSA, who enjoy diplomatic status on Swiss territory and are exempt from the indirect taxes on the basis of a decision of the Federal Council and the persons in their entourage, provided such enjoy the same diplomatic status.

4 Swiss citizens have no claim to tax relief.

5 Relief from VAT is effected by tax exemption at source under Articles 144 and 145 and, in exceptional cases, by refund under Article 146.

[**Art. 144** Tax exemption](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_144) 

(Art. 107 para. 1 let. a VAT Act)

|    a. supplies of goods and services on Swiss territory by taxable persons to institutional and individual beneficiaries;  
|    b. the acquisition of supplies from businesses with their place of business abroad by institutional and individual beneficiaries.

2 The tax exemption applies only to supplies of goods and supplies of services:


|    a. to individual beneficiaries if they are exclusively for personal use;  
|    b. to institutional beneficiaries if they are exclusively for official use.

[**Art. 145** Conditions for the tax exemption](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_145) 

(Art. 107 para. 1 let. a VAT Act)

1 An institutional beneficiary that wishes to claim a tax exemption must before every acquisition of supplies certify on the official form that the supplies acquired are for official use.

2 An individual beneficiary who wishes to claim tax exemption must before every acquisition of supplies have certified by the institutional beneficiary to which the person belongs, on the official form, that the person enjoys the status under Article 143 paragraph 3, which confers entitlement to tax free acquisition. The individual beneficiary must hand over the official form signed in person to the supplier and identify himself on every acquisition of supplies with the identification card issued by the competent federal authority.

3 A tax exemption under Article 144 paragraph 1 letter a may be claimed only if the effective acquisition price for the supplies indicated on the invoice or an equivalent document is at least 100 francs, including tax. This minimum amount does not apply to telecommunications and electronic services under Article 10 and for supplies of water in pipes, gas and electricity by utility companies.

4 The conditions under paragraphs 1–3 for claiming tax exemption do not apply to acquisitions of motor fuel for which the institutional or the individual beneficiary may claim exemption from the mineral oil tax based on Articles 26–28 of the Mineral Oil Tax Ordinance of 20 November 1996, on Articles 30 and 31 of the Ordinance of 23 August 1989 on the Customs Privileges of Diplomatic Missions in Bern and Consular Posts on Swiss territory and of Articles 28 and 29 of the Ordinance of 13 November 1985 on the Customs Privileges of International Organisations, of States in their relations with such Organisations and of Special Missions of Foreign States.

1 In justified cases, the FTA may on application refund tax amounts already paid for which a claim to tax relief exists; it may, in consultation with the FDFA, charge a processing fee for this service.

2 For the tax refund, Article 145 paragraph 3 applies by analogy.

3 An institutional beneficiary may not make more than two applications for a tax refund per calendar year. The official form must be used.

4 Individual beneficiaries may not make more than one application for a tax refund per calendar year. The applications by individual persons must be collected by the organisation to which they belong for submission once annually.

5 The FTA may, in consultation with the FDFA, set a minimum refund amount per application. No payment interest is paid on the refund amounts.

(Art. 107 para. 1 let. a VAT Act)

1 If the conditions for a tax exemption under Articles 144 and 145 are not met or subsequently not fulfilled, in cases of tax exemption under Article 144 paragraph 1 letter a the institutional or the individual beneficiary is obliged to pay the taxable person an amount equivalent to the tax due. If this amount is not paid, it is due by the taxable person, to the extent this person is at fault. Institutional and individual beneficiaries are obliged to pay the tax subsequently on the acquisition of supplies of services from businesses with their place of business abroad.

2 The provisions of the Vienna Conventions dated 18 April 1961 on Diplomatic Relations and dated 24 April 1963 on Consular Relations and of the Headquarters Agreement are reserved.

[**Art. 150** Voluntary taxation of supplies exempt without credit](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_150) 

(Art. 107 para. 1 let. a VAT Act)

The FTA can approve the voluntary taxation of the supplies referred to in Article 21 paragraph 2 numbers 20 and 21 VAT Act, without the value of the land, provided they have been made to institutional beneficiaries under Article 143 paragraph 2 letter a, regardless whether the institutional beneficiary is liable for tax on Swiss territory or not.

1 The right to a refund of the taxes incurred under Article 28 paragraph 1 letter a and c VAT Act shall be granted to persons who import goods or have supplies made on the territory of the Swiss Confederation against a consideration provided they also:


|    a. have their domicile, place of business or permanent establishment abroad;  
|    b. are not a taxable person on Swiss territory;  
|    c. do not make supplies on Swiss territory subject to paragraph 2; and  
|    d. prove to the FTA their business character in the state of their domicile, of their place of business or of the permanent establishment.

3 Refund of the tax is conditional on the state of residence or of place of business or of the permanent establishment of the applicant business granting a corresponding reciprocal right.

[**Art. 152** Reciprocal right](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_152) 

(Art. 107 para. 1 let. b VAT Act)

1 Reciprocal right is deemed to be given if:

|    b. in the foreign state concerned a tax comparable with the Swiss VAT is not imposed; or  
|    c. in the foreign state concerned a different type of sales tax from the Swiss VAT is imposed, which affects businesses with their domicile or place of business in the foreign state in the same way as businesses with their domicile or place of business on Swiss territory.

2 The FTA shall maintain a list of the states with which a reciprocal right declaration has been exchanged under paragraph 1 letter a.

[**Art. 153** Scope of the tax refund](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_153)

Value added tax paid on supplies that are not subject to or exempt from tax under the VAT Act is not refunded.

2 Travel agents and organisers of events with their place of business abroad are not entitled to refunds of the taxes which have been invoiced to them on the territory of the Swiss Confederation for the acquisition of supplies of goods and supplies of services that they charge on to customers.

3 Repayable taxes are refunded only if their amount in a calendar year reaches at least 500 francs.

[**Art. 154**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_154) [Refund period](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_154)

1 The refund period corresponds to the calendar year. The application for a refund must be made within six months of the end of the calendar year in which an invoice was issued for the supply made.

[**Art. 155** Procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/828/en#art_155) 

(Art. 107 para. 1 let. b VAT Act)

1 The application for a tax refund must be addressed to the FTA with the suppliers’ original invoices or with the FOCBS’ assessment advice. The original invoices must meet the requirements under Article 26 paragraph 2 VAT Act and be in the name of the applicant.

2 The FTA’s form must be used for the application.

3 The applicant must appoint a representative with domicile or with a place of business on Swiss territory.

4 The tax displayed on cash receipts may not be refunded.
