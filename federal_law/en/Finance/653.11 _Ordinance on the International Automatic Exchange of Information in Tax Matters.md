|    d. other income.

[2]Interest is in particular interest on bonds, mortgage certificates and land charge certificates issued in series, debt register assets and client assets.

[3]Dividends are in particular distributions of profit, liquidation surpluses and pecuniary benefits from financial interests of all kinds, including bonus shares, bonus nominal value increases and the like.

[4]Proceeds from sales or redemptions are in particular proceeds from the sale or redemption of the following:


|    a. bonds, insofar as the proceeds are not interest;

[2]Insurance contracts where the occurrence of the insured event is definite but which the insurer does not yet have to redeem in full or in part are treated as cash value insurance contracts.

[3]In order for a contract to qualify as an annuity contract, it is irrelevant whether it provides temporary or indefinite life cover. Endowment insurance contracts are not treated as annuity contracts.

[**Art. 24** Refund of unused premiums as part of the cash value](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2016/786/en#art_24)

[2]If a new individual or entity account is closed and the tax residence of the account holder or controlling person of the entity could not be determined by the reporting Swiss financial institution up to the time of closure, the financial institution may treat it as a non-reportable account.

[3]If a preexisting or new individual or entity account is closed following a change in circumstances and the re-examination of the account required by the change in circumstances has not been completed by the time of closure, the reporting Swiss financial institution need not take the change in circumstances into account for the report.

[**Art. 29** Third-party claims arising from cash value insurance contracts and annuity contracts upon maturity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2016/786/en#art_29) 

[1]If a claim arising from a cash value insurance contract or an annuity contract becomes due and the individual or entity entitled to the claim is not the previous account holder, this third party entitled to the claim shall be treated as the holder of a new account.

[2]Before fulfilling the claim, the reporting Swiss financial institution must have a self-certification from the third party entitled to the claim. This is without prejudice to cases where the financial institution:


|    a. can establish on the basis of information in its possession or public information that the entity entitled to the claim is not a reportable person;  
|    b. can apply the alternative procedure for financial accounts held by individual beneficiaries of a cash value insurance contract or an annuity contract in accordance with the applicable due diligence obligations in the CRS.

[3]If the reporting Swiss financial institution is unable to fulfil the claim arising from the contract due to the absence of a self-certification, the third party entitled to the claim is in default. The consequences of default will be suspended for the financial institution until the self-certification is received.

[4]Article 11 paragraphs 8 and 9 of the AEOIA do not apply.

[**Art. 30**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2016/786/en#art_30)

[1]A Swiss financial institution must register with the Federal Tax Administration (FTA) at the latest by the end of the calendar year in which it becomes a reporting Swiss financial institution.

[2]A reporting Swiss financial institution must de-register with the FTA at the latest by the end of the calendar year in which its capacity as a reporting Swiss financial institution ceases to apply or in which it ceases its commercial activity.

[3]If the reporting Swiss financial institution notifies the FTA that it does not maintain any reportable financial accounts, this is not treated as de-registration.

[4] In the case of a trust that must reported under Article 13 paragraph 4 AEOIA, the trustee must add «TDT=» before the name of the trust. Article 13 paragraphs 2 and 3 AEOIA applies by analogy.

[2]If the same data of various FTA organisational units is processed, the corresponding information systems can be networked to exchange master data, insofar as this is necessary for efficient data processing.

[3]The FDF may specify detailed rules for the organisation and operation of the FTA's information system.

[**Art. 34** Categories of personal data processed](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2016/786/en#art_34)
