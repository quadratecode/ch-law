[8] A reporting Swiss financial institution may only open a new account without obtaining self-certification from the account holder if:


|    a. the account holder is an entity and the institution reasonably establishes, based on information that is in its possession or publicly available, that it is a non-reportable person; or  
|    b. another exception applies; in this case, it must receive the self-certification and check its plausibility within 90 days; the Federal Council shall describe the exceptions in more detail.

[9] If, within 90 days of a new account being opened, a reporting Swiss financial institution does not have the information required under the applicable agreement and this Act to check the plausibility of the self-certification or, in an exceptional case in accordance with paragraph 8 letter b, does not have the self-certification, it must close the account or block all transfers to and from the account until all the information has been received. The institution shall have an extraordinary right of termination. Cases pursuant to Article 9 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 10 October 1997 (AMLA) are reserved.
