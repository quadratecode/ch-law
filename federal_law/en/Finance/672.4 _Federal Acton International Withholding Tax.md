# [Section 7: Upfront Payment by Swiss Paying Agents](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/6/en#sec_7)

[**Art. 26** Execution of upfront payment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/6/en#art_26) 

[1] Where the applicable agreement provides for an upfront payment, Swiss paying agents shall arrange for the formation of an implementation vehicle which shall manage on their behalf all rights and administrative obligations arising in conjunction with the execution of the upfront payment.

[2] The implementation vehicle shall not be liable for obligations under the applicable agreement and this Section, subject to the provisions of paragraph 3. It shall inform the FTA of all facts of relevance to the implementation of this Section.

[3] The Federal Council shall specify the date on which the upfront payment to the FTA becomes due. It shall also specify the deadline by which the implementation vehicle shall issue an irrevocable loan commitment to the FTA. Where the amount of the irrevocable loan commitment is lower than the upfront payment set out in the applicable agreement, the implementation vehicle shall inform the FTA, before expiry of this deadline, which Swiss paying agents have participated and how much they have contributed to the upfront payment. 

[4] Where the upfront payment set out in the applicable agreement has not been paid in full by the deadline set by the Federal Council, the FTA shall issue the payment orders necessary for timely execution of the upfront payment.

[5] It shall issue payment orders to Swiss paying agents accounting for more than 0.5% of the retention levied under the Agreement on the Taxation of Savings in relation to the partner state. The share determined on the basis of the last statistics furnished by paying agents to the FTA prior to the applicable agreement being signed is decisive. The upfront payment shall be divided among these paying agents based on their respective share.

[6] The FTA shall not issue any payment orders to those paying agents participating in the implementation vehicle if the contribution made by the implementation vehicle fully covers the total contributions payable by such paying agents to the upfront payment. Otherwise, the FTA shall deduct the contribution already paid by a paying agent from the corresponding payment order, provided that it has reliable knowledge that the contribution has been paid.

[7] The FTA shall transfer to the Swiss paying agents or the implementation vehicle the amount of the one-off payments offset against the upfront payment in proportion to their share in the upfront payment.

[**Art. 27** Sureties and procedural rules](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/6/en#art_27) 

[1] Where the contribution is deemed to be at risk, the FTA may require security for the upfront payment or part thereof even before it becomes due. It shall specify in the security order the amount to be secured and the office with which the security is to be deposited. 

[2] The office receiving the security shall be authorised to release it only if so directed by a legally binding court order or if the Swiss paying agent in question and the FTA jointly submit a written declaration to this effect.

[3] An appeal against security orders from the FTA may be filed with the Federal Administrative Court. The appeal shall not have any suspensive effect.

[**Art. 28** Shortfall](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/6/en#art_28) 

[1] Where the executed upfront payment cannot be fully offset against one-off payments, the FTA shall issue the necessary payment orders. These shall be addressed to Swiss paying agents accounting for more than 0.01% of the retention levied under the Agreement on the Taxation of Savings in relation to the partner state. The share determined on the basis of the last statistics furnished by paying agents to the FTA prior to the applicable agreement being signed is decisive.

[2] The part of the upfront payment that is not offset shall be divided among these paying agents based on their respective share. Where a paying agent has contributed to the upfront payment, the difference between this contribution and the amounts transferred in accordance with Article 26 paragraph 7 shall be deducted from this share.

[3] The FTA shall transfer the amounts collected to the paying agents such that they cover the shortfall in accordance with their shares under paragraph 1.

[4] Article 38 applies mutatis mutandis.

# [Section 8: Relevant Assets Withdrawn from Switzerland](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/6/en#sec_8)

|    a. the number of relevant persons who closed their account or deposit between the date of signature of the applicable agreement and appointed date 3, broken down by destination state or jurisdiction to which the relevant assets were transferred;   
|    b. the volume of relevant assets transferred by relevant persons who closed their account or deposit between the date of signature of the applicable agreement and appointed date 3, broken down by destination state or jurisdiction to which the relevant assets were transferred.

[2] Where a relevant person transfers the relevant assets held in his or her account or deposit at the date of signature to several states or jurisdictions, then:


|    a. for the purposes of counting the number of relevant persons, they are assigned to the state or jurisdiction to which they transferred the highest amount;  
|    b. for the purposes of counting the volume, the transferred relevant assets are assigned to the states and jurisdictions to which they were transferred.

[3] Swiss paying agents shall compile this data on the basis of the value of the relevant assets on appointed date 2.
