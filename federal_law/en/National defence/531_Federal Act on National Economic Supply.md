This Act regulates the measures designed to guarantee the country’s supply of essential goods and services in times of serious shortages that the private sector itself is unable to respond to.

[**Art. 2** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/308/en#art_2) 

In this Act:


|    a. *national economic supply* means supplying the country with essential goods and services;  
|    b. *severe shortages* is a supply situation in which there is an extreme risk of immediate, major damage to the economy or considerable disruption to national economic supply;  
|    c. *specialist divisions* are organisational units composed of specialists from the private sector and the Confederation, cantons and communes responsible for implementing this Act;

[2] If the private sector is unable to guarantee national economic supply in times of severe shortages, the Confederation and, if necessary, the cantons shall take any measures required.

[3] The private sector and the public sector shall cooperate. Before any implementing provisions are issued, it should first be ensured that the private sector is unable to ensure national economic supply through voluntary measures.

[**Art. 4** Essential goods and services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/308/en#art_4) 

[1] Goods and services are regarded as essential if they are required directly or through economic processes to overcome serious shortages.

[2] Essential goods are, in particular:


|    energy sources, together with all the means of production and processing required therefor;   
|    foodstuffs, feedstuffs, therapeutic products, seed and plants;   
|    other indispensable goods that meet day-to-day needs;   
|    raw materials and auxiliary agents for agriculture, trade and industry. 

[3] Essential services are, in particular:

[4] If the voluntary measures taken by the private sector are insufficient, the Federal Council may require companies that are of particular importance to national economic supply to ensure that they are in a position to continue production, processing and delivery, and in particular to have technical and administrative measures in place.

[5] The foregoing applies without prejudice to the activities of other public authorities to ensure the supply of essential goods and services. 

[**Art. 6** Industry agreements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/308/en#art_6)

|    b. they are in accordance with the federal supply targets;  
|    c. they guarantee equality of rights, do not violate any mandatory federal or cantonal provisions and do not permanently affect the interests of other economic sectors; and

[2] Private or public law rights to such compulsory stocks and indemnity rights that are held by third parties in terms of the law or the agreement shall remain ineffective in the event that the Confederation holds a right of separation settlement or of lien. The sole exception to the foregoing is the lien held by the owner of storage depots in respect of claims under Article 485 of the Code of Obligations.

|    c. the owner of stocks has been granted a debt restructuring moratorium or emergency moratorium.

[2] If the value of the compulsory stock or the indemnity rights at the time of the actual takeover or the concluded sale and after deduction of all costs exceeds the value of the rights of the Confederation or the third-party undertaking following its repayment of the loans, the Confederation or the third-party undertaking shall first of all settle the liabilities of the compulsory stock owner towards the guarantee fund. The remainder shall pass to the insolvent estate or, in the case of stay of bankruptcy, or debt restructuring moratorium and emergency moratorium proceedings, to the debtor.

[3] If the Confederation or third-party undertaking, after deduction of all the costs, is not repaid in full by taking ownership of or selling the goods, it shall participate in the bankruptcy proceedings or in the composition agreement. In the case of a stay of bankruptcy or an emergency moratorium on debt enforcement, the Confederation or third-party undertaking shall acquire an interest-bearing claim against the debtor that is not subject to prescription.

[2] Third parties with statutory or contractual rights to the compulsory stock acquire a right to be paid as creditors in respect of their claims that ranks immediately behind the Confederation and, if applicable, behind the guarantee fund.

[3] Third-party claims to compulsory stocks or equivalent claims of the debtor can only be made in a debt enforcement process. 

[**Art. 26** Avoidance actions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/308/en#art_26) 

Avoidance claims in accordance with Articles 285–292 of the Federal Act of 11 April 1889 on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy resulting from rulings on goods for which the Confederation or a third party have a right of separation in accordance with Article 24 of this act or a lien in accordance with Article 25 can only be assigned to a creditor once the Confederation or third party has waived the claims.
