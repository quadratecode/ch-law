[**Art. 5** Licensing criteria for export trade](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/808_808_808/en#art_5) 

(Art. 22 WMA) 

1 In the granting of a licence for export trade and for contracts under Article 20 WMA, the following is taken into account:


|    a. the maintenance of peace, international security and regional stability;  
|    b. the situation in the country of destination, in particular with regard to respect for human rights and the non-use of child soldiers;  
|    c. the efforts made by Switzerland in the area of development cooperation, and in particular the possibility that the country of destination is listed as one of the least developed countries on the current OECD-DAC list of countries in receipt of development aid;  
|    d. the conduct of the country of destination towards the international community, in particular with regard to compliance with international law;  
|    e. the attitude of the countries which are participating with Switzerland in international export control regimes.

[2] Licences shall not be granted for export trade and for contracts under Article 20 WMA if:


|    a. the country of destination is involved in an internal or international armed conflict;  
|    b. the country of destination violates human rights in a systematic and serious manner;   
|    c. ...  
|    d. in the country of destination there is a high risk that the exported war materiel will be used against the civilian population; or  
|    e. in the country of destination there is a high risk that the exported war materiel will be passed on to an undesirable end recipient.

[3] In derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, a licence may be granted for individual weapons in Category WM 1 of Annex 1 with the ammunition pertaining thereto, provided the weapons are used exclusively for private or sporting purposes.

[4] In derogation from paragraph 2 letter b, a licence may be granted if there is a low risk that the exported war materiel will be used to commit serious violations of human rights.

[**Art. 5***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/808_808_808/en#art_5_a) [Non-re-export declarations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/808_808_808/en#art_5_a) 

(Art. 18 WMA)

[1] For a licence to be granted for the export of finished products or for individual parts or assembly packages to a foreign government or an undertaking acting on behalf of a foreign government, a non-re-export declaration from the government of the country of destination is required. The requirement for a non-re-export declaration is waived if the case involves individual parts or assembly packages of negligible value.

[2] By issuing the non-re-export declaration, the country of destination undertakes not to export, sell, lend, or gift the war materiel authority or to transfer it in any other way to third parties abroad without the consent of the licensing authority.

[3] If there is an increased risk in the country of destination that the war materiel to be exported will be passed on to an undesirable end recipient, the licensing authority may stipulate that it has the right to verify compliance with the non-re-export declaration on site. In the case of export of substantial volume, a non-re-export declaration in the form of a diplomatic note from the country of destination is required.

[4] If there is evidence that the non-re-export declaration has been violated, the licensing authority may take precautionary measures. The Federal Department of Economic Affairs decides whether a licence should be revoked.

[**Art. 5***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/808_808_808/en#art_5_b) [Exports to non-governmental bodies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/808_808_808/en#art_5_b)
