[3] The programmes must not jeopardise the internal or external security of the Confederation or cantons, their constitutional order or the observance of Switzerland’s obligations under international law.

[4] Licensed programme services must appropriately express the variety of events and opinions in the totality of their editorial programmes. If a coverage area is served by an adequate number of programme services, the licensing authority may release one or more broadcasters in the licence from the variety obligation.

Companies active in the area of therapeutic products may sponsor programmes provided no products for which advertising is banned are named or shown and no advertising effect is created for these products in some other way.

[5] News programmes and programmes on political current events, as well as programmes and sequences of programmes which are related to the exercise of political rights in the Confederation, cantons and communes may not be sponsored.

## [Chapter 3 Other Broadcasters with a Mandate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#tit_2/chap_3)

### [Section 1 Licences with a Performance Mandate and a Share of Fees](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_1)


[**Art. 38** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_38) 

[1] Licences with a performance mandate and a share of fees (fee-sharing licences) may be awarded to broadcasters of local-regional programme services which:


|    a. provide to an area that has no adequate funding options radio and television programme services which take account of local or regional particularities by providing comprehensive information, particularly on political, economic and social matters and which contribute to the development of cultural life in the coverage area;  
|    b. contribute to the fulfilment of the mandate under the Federal Constitution in urban areas by means of complementary, non-profit-orientated radio programme services.

[2] Fee-sharing licences give an entitlement to broadcast the programme service within a specific coverage area (right of access) and to a proportion of the revenue from radio and television fees.

[3] One fee-sharing licence is awarded for each coverage area.

[4] The licence specifies as a minimum:


|    a. the coverage area and the technical means of broadcasting;  
|    b. the required programme services and the operational and organisational requirements necessary for these;  
|    c. other requirements and conditions which the licensee must fulfil.

[5] ...

[**Art. 39** Coverage areas](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_39) 

[1] After consultation with the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Council determines the number and extent of the coverage in which fee-sharing licences are awarded, as well as the technical means of broadcasting in the coverage area concerned. When it does so, it distinguishes between coverage areas for radio and for television.

[2] Coverage areas in accordance with Article 38 paragraph 1 letter a must be defined so that:


|    a. they constitute a political and geographical unit or are marked by especially close cultural or economic contacts; and  
|    b. their existing funding options together with an appropriate proportion of the revenue from radio and television fees allow the broadcaster to fulfil its performance mandate.

[3] Exceptions may be made for regional programme services which are broadcast in at least two national languages in a multilingual area.

[4] The number and extent of the coverage areas are examined by the Federal Council periodically but after ten years at the latest. DETEC may make minor adjustments to the extent.

[5] Before defining the coverage areas and before significant changes, the cantons and the licensed broadcasters directly concerned shall be consulted.

[**Art. 40** Share of fees](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_40) 

[1] The share of fees for broadcasters receiving a share of fees in terms of Article 68*a* paragraph 1 letter b amounts to 4 to 6 per cent of the revenue from radio and television fees. The Federal Council decides: 


|    a. when fixing the amount of the fee, on the respective shares allocated to radio and television, taking account of the need to fulfil the performance mandates in accordance with Article 38 paragraph 1;  
|    b. the maximum percentage which the share of fees may make to the operating costs of the individual broadcaster.

[2] DETEC lays down each licensee’s share of the revenue from radio and television fees for a specific period. It takes into consideration the size and economic potential of the coverage area as well as the expenditure which the licensee must incur to fulfil the performance mandate including transmission costs.

[3] The provisions of the Subsidies Act of 5 October 1990 apply.

[**Art. 41** Obligations of broadcasters with fee-sharing licences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_41) 

[1] Broadcasters which hold a fee-sharing licence must fulfil the performance mandate defined in the licence. In order to ensure the fulfilment of the performance mandate and of independent programme production, the Federal Council may impose other obligations. In particular, it may oblige the broadcasters to produce a mission statement and editorial statutes.

[2] Broadcasters with a fee-sharing licence must use the financial resources economically and in accordance with the regulations. Distribution of profits is not permitted. Broadcasting of the fee-supported programme service must be separated in the accounts from any other economic activities carried out by the licensee. If an undertaking which is economically controlled by the licensee carries out activities in connection with the programme service, the licensee shall ensure that these activities are kept separate in the accounts from other activities.

[3] Cooperation with other broadcasters must not jeopardise the fulfilment of the performance mandate or the independence of programme production.

[**Art. 42** Financial supervision](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_42) 

[1] The licensee shall submit the accounts to OFCOM on an annual basis. The latter shall examine whether the financial resources have been used economically and in accordance with the regulations. If not, it may reduce or reclaim the share of fees from a licensee.

[2] OFCOM may also request information from the licensee and from those obliged to provide information in accordance with Article 17 paragraph 2 letter a–c and carry out on-the-spot financial audits.

[3] Audits on grounds of pure expediency are not permitted.

### [Section 2 Licence with Performance Mandate but without a Share of Fees](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_2)


[**Art. 43**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_43) 

[1] DETEC may award other broadcasters a licence for wireless terrestrial broadcasting of a programme service if this programme service:


|    a. takes account of local or regional particularities in an area by means of comprehensive information, particularly concerning political, economic and social matters and contributes to the development of cultural life in the coverage area;  
|    b. contributes to a significant extent in a linguistic region to the fulfilment of the performance mandate provided for by the Constitution.

[2] The licence defines the scope of access to technical means of broadcasting and the performance mandate with regard to programme services. DETEC may impose other obligations in order to ensure the fulfilment of the performance mandate and the independence of programme production.

### [Section 3 Licensing Regulations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_3)

[**Art. 44** General licence requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_44) 

[1] A licence may be awarded if the candidate:


|    a. is able to fulfil the performance mandate;  
|    b. credibly demonstrates that it can finance the necessary investments and operation;  
|    c. demonstrates to the licensing authority the identity of the majority holder of its capital and who makes substantial financial resources available to it;  
|    d. guarantees that it complies with the employment law regulations and the working conditions of the industry, the applicable law and in particular the obligations and conditions associated with the licence;  
|    e. separates editorial activity from economic activities;  
|    f. is a natural person with residence in Switzerland or a legal person domiciled in Switzerland;  
|    g. ...

[2] In the absence of any international obligations to the contrary, a legal person controlled from abroad, a domestic legal person with foreign participation or a natural person without Swiss citizenship may be refused the licence if the corresponding foreign state does not guarantee reciprocal rights to a similar extent.

[3] A broadcaster or the undertaking to which it belongs may acquire a maximum of two television licences and two radio licences. The Federal Council may permit exceptions for the introduction of new broadcasting technologies.

[**Art. 45** Licensing procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_45) 

[1] Licences are awarded by DETEC. As a rule, OFCOM puts the licences out to tender; it may consult interested parties.

[1bis]Licences may be extended with a public tendering process, in particular where the situation in the coverage areas or technological changes pose significant challenges to broadcasters. In reaching a decision, account is taken of previous fulfilment of the performance mandate.

[2] The Federal Council may provide for a special procedure for the award of short-term licences.

[3] If there are several candidates for one licence, preference is given to the candidate that is best able to fulfil the performance mandate. If several candidates are essentially equivalent from this viewpoint, preference is given to the candidate which best enhances to the diversity of opinion and the diversity of programming.

[4] Licences for wireless terrestrial transmission of programme services are as a rule awarded before the invitation to tender for the corresponding radiocommunication licences in accordance with Article 22*a* TCA.

[**Art. 46** Term and expiry of licences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_46) 

[1] Each licence is awarded for a specific term. As a rule, comparable licences are limited to the same term.

[2] A licence expires in the case of relinquishment by the broadcaster, on withdrawal and on expiry of its term.

[**Art. 47** Fulfilment of the performance mandate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_47) 

[1] OFCOM examines whether the licensed programme service fulfils the performance mandate. For purposes of clarification, it may call in external expertise or experts.

[2] If it finds substantial shortcomings, it takes measures. It may notably reduce the claim to shares of fees by up to half until the shortcomings are remedied.

[**Art. 48** Transfer of the licence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_48) 

[1] A transfer of the licence must be notified to DETEC before it takes place and must be approved by the latter.

[2] DETEC examines whether the licence requirements are also met after the transfer. It may refuse approval within three months of receipt of notification; in particular cases the period may be extended.

[3] Economic transfer of the licence is also deemed to be a transfer. Such a case applies if more than 20 per cent of the share capital, nominal capital or registered capital or where applicable the participating capital or voting rights are transferred.

[**Art. 49** Amendment of the licence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_49) 

[1] [DETEC may amend individual provisions of the licence before its term expires if the actual or legal conditions have changed and the amendment is nece][s][sary to safeguard important public interests.]

[2] The licensee is appropriately compensated if the amendment substantially restricts the rights granted with the licence. It receives no compensation if the amendment is based on important national interests or on a change in international obligations.

[3] At the request of the broadcaster, DETEC may amend individual conditions if the amendment applied for corresponds to the requirements for the award of the licence.

[**Art. 50** Restriction, suspension and withdrawal of the licence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_50) 

[1] DETEC may restrict, suspend or withdraw the licence if:


|    a. the licensee has acquired it as a result of incomplete or incorrect information;  
|    b. the licensee seriously violates this Act or its implementing provisions;  
|    c. the licensee continuously fails to meet its obligations laid down in the licence despite measures under Article 47 paragraph 2;  
|    d. the licensee seriously exploits the licence for unlawful purposes;  
|    e. important national interests so require.

[2] DETEC shall withdraw the licence if essential conditions relating to the award thereof are no longer applicable.

[3] The licensee has a claim to compensation if DETEC:


|    a. withdraws the licence because essential conditions relating to the award thereof cease to exist and the Confederation is responsible for this;  
|    b. suspends or withdraws the licence because important national interests so require.

[3] Article 47 TCA concerning communication in extraordinary situations is applicable to broadcasters which transmit their programme services themselves.

[**Art. 52** Restrictions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_52) 

[1] OFCOM may restrict or prohibit the transmission of a programme service using telecommunications techniques if the programme service:


|    a. infringes international telecommunications law which is binding on Switzerland;  
|    b. seriously and continuously violates the international regulations which are binding on Switzerland regarding programme content, advertising or sponsorship; or  
|    c. is the subject of a ban on broadcasting in accordance with Article 89 paragraph 2.

[2] Both the broadcaster of the programme service in question and the telecommunications service provider which broadcasts the programme service or feeds the signal for broadcasting may object to the decision of OFCOM.

## [Chapter 2 Wireless Terrestrial Broadcasting of Programme Services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#tit_3/chap_2)

[**Art. 53** Access-entitled programme services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_53) 

The following are access-entitled for wireless terrestrial broadcasting within the framework of the licence:


|    a. the programme services of the SRG SSR;  
|    b. the programme services of broadcasters which hold a licence with a performance mandate.

[**Art. 54**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_54) [Frequencies for programme services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_54) 

[1] The Federal Council shall ensure that sufficient frequencies are made available to fulfil the constitutional performance mandate of radio and television (Art. 93 para. 2 FC). In particular, it shall ensure that access-entitled programme services can be transmitted using wireless terrestrial technology in the intended coverage area and shall specify the relevant principles.

[2] For frequencies or frequency blocks which are used in accordance with the national frequency allocation plan (Art. 25 TCA) for the broadcasting of radio and television programme services, it determines:


|    a. the broadcasting area;  
|    b. the number of radio or television programme services which are to be broadcast, or the transmission capacities which are to be reserved for the broadcasting of programme services.

[3] In accordance with the requirements specified by the Federal Council, DETEC shall ensure that sufficient broadcasting of programme services can be assured to serve the population in extraordinary situations.

[**Art. 55** Broadcasting obligation and broadcasting conditions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_55) 

[1] Any person acquiring a radiocommunication licence for the utilisation of a frequency which is intended for the broadcasting of an access-entitled programme service must broadcast the latter in adequate quality and respect the provisions of the licence with regard to programme services and of the radiocommunication licence with regard to telecommunications law.

[2] Broadcasters pay the owner of a radiocommunication licence cost-based compensation for the broadcasting of access-entitled programme services. The Federal Council determines the chargeable costs. If the radiocommunication licence is awarded in a bidding procedure, the award price as mentioned in Article 39 paragraph 4 TCA is not included in the chargeable costs.

[3] The Federal Council may extend the transmission obligation to services which are coupled with access-entitled programme services.

[**Art. 56** Procedures for agreement and decision making](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_56) 

[1] If the parties cannot agree on the broadcasting obligation and broadcasting conditions within three months, OFCOM adjudicates.

[2] For the decision, it refers to comparable domestic or foreign reference values in so far as the parties do not produce evidence which justifies deviation therefrom.

[3] For the period from the submission of the application to the legally-enforceable decision, it may order transmission on an interim basis and fix the financial conditions.

[4] The procedure and the obligation to provide information are based, *mutatis muta**n**dis*, on the provisions of the TCA on the granting of access by dominant providers (Art. 11, 11*a* and 11*b* TCA).

[**Art. 57** Support for the broadcasting of radio programme services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_57) 

[1] In accordance with Article 38 paragraph 1 letter a, OFCOM provides a contribution to a broadcaster with a fee-sharing licence which incurs additional expense for the wireless terrestrial broadcasting of its radio programme service in a mountain region.

[2] The Federal Council shall regulate the conditions and calculation criteria by which OFCOM pays the contributions.

[**Art. 58**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_58) [Promoting new broadcasting technologies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_58) 

[1] OFCOM may for a limited period subsidise the introduction of new technologies for broadcasting programme services by contributing to the cost of constructing and operating transmitter networks, provided that insufficient funding options are available in the corresponding coverage area.

[2] It may provide the public with information on new technologies, in particular the technical requirements and possible applications, and work with third parties to do so.

[3] The subsidies in terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be paid for from the revenue from the licence fee (Art. 22) and, if this is not sufficient, from the revenue from the radio and television fee.

[4] When determining the amount of the radio and television fee (Art. 70), the Federal Council shall determine the proportion which is available for subsidies. This is shall amount to no more than one per cent of the total revenue from the radio and television fee.

## [Chapter 3 Broadcasting by Wire](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#tit_3/chap_3)

[**Art. 59** Access-entitled and foreign programme services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_59) 

[1] In their coverage area, the following must be broadcast by wire:


|    a. programme services of the SRG SSR within the framework of the licence;  
|    b. programme services based on a licence with a performance mandate.

[2] The Federal Council may also specify programme services of foreign broadcasters which are to be transmitted by wire because of their special contribution to education, cultural development or free opinion-forming.

[3] The Federal Council determines the maximum number of access-entitled programme services in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 within the framework of the technical capabilities of telecommunications service providers. The programme services are to be transmitted free of charge and in adequate quality.

[4] The telecommunications service provider which already broadcasts programme services in the coverage area and reaches the most households is primarily subject to the broadcasting obligation. Within the same coverage area, OFCOM may require more than one telecommunications service provider if this is necessary to ensure that a programme service can be received by the general public. In the event of refusal, OFCOM may arrange immediate broadcasting by way of precaution.

[5] If compliance with this obligation leads to an unreasonable economic burden on the telecommunications service provider, OFCOM shall require the access-entitled broadcaster to pay appropriate compensation.

[6] The Federal Council may extend the transmission obligation to services which are coupled with access-entitled programme services.

[**Art. 60** Other broadcasting obligations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_60) 

[1] On application by a broadcaster, OFCOM shall require a telecommunications service provider for a specific period to provide broadcasting by wire of a programme service within a specific area, if:


|    a. the programme service contributes to a significant extent to the fulfilment of the mandate under the Constitution; and  
|    b. broadcasting can reasonably be expected from the telecommunications service provider taking account of the available transmission capacities and its economic capacity.

[2] The Federal Council determines the maximum number of programme services.

[3] OFCOM may withdraw the right prior to expiry of the decreed term if the broadcaster no longer provides the services stated in the decision.

[4][The Federal Council may extend the transmission obligation to services which are coupled with access-entitled programme services.]

[**Art. 61** Transmission by wire of other programme services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_61) 

In the case of the broadcasting of programme services not regulated by Articles 59 and 60, the telecommunications service provider decides on the basis of its capacities for transmitting programme services. In particular, the economic benefit of the broadcasting service to the broadcaster may be taken into account in the payment of the broadcasting costs.

[**Art. 61***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_61_a) [Time-delayed television viewing](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_61_a) 

[1] Time-delayed television viewing is defined as the television programme service of a broadcaster that is transmitted and recorded by a telecommunications service provider and which the telecommunications service provider makes available to its end customers for viewing in its entirety for a limited period of time in compliance with the provisions on copyright.

[2] Telecommunications service providers that offer time-delayed television viewing may not make any modifications to the linear television programme services that they transmit and record without the consent of the broadcaster. The rules on advertising and sponsorship apply by analogy to time-delayed television viewing.

[3] In order to guarantee the protection of young people, the Federal Council may issue provisions on the accessibility of television programme services by means of time-delayed television viewing. In doing so, it shall take account of the age rating systems recognised in Switzerland.

[**Art. 62** Channel occupancy](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_62) 

The Federal Council may decree that telecommunications service providers broadcast the programme to be transmitted in accordance with Article 59 paragraphs 1 and 2 on preferred channels.

## [Chapter 4 Technical Processing of Programme Services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#tit_3/chap_4)

[**Art. 63** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_63) 

[1] Access to technical processing must be guaranteed to broadcasters on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. If processing using the telecommunications service provider’s equipment essentially corresponds to the state of the art, the broadcaster is not entitled to use its own equipment for processing.

[2] Any person providing services as a higher-level user interface which control programme service selection must use the state of the art to ensure that reference is clearly made in the first stage of use to access-entitled programme services.

[3] Operators and providers of processing services or equipment must:


|    a. provide third parties with a justified interest with all information and disclose all documentation, the knowledge of which is necessary to enforce the rights in paragraph 1;  
|    b. provide OFCOM on its request with all information and submit all documentation which is necessary to verify whether the obligations in the provisions on technical processing are being complied with.

[4] The Federal Council may extend the provisions on technical processing to coupled services.

[5] If no regulations exist for specific circumstances, OFCOM shall in individual cases take the decisions required to safeguard diversity of opinion and diversity of programming.

[**Art. 64** Open interfaces and technical configuration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_64) 

In so far as is necessary to safeguard diversity of opinion, the Federal Council may, after consultation with the parties concerned, stipulate open interfaces or decree other provisions concerning their technical configuration for equipment or services which are used for processing of programme services. In so doing, it takes account of the equipment or services already on the market and allows appropriate transitional periods.

[**Art. 65** Unbundling](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_65) 

[1] Any person offering programme services as bundled packages or providing services which are used for the processing of programme services must fulfil the technical requirements that enable third parties to broadcast these programme services individually under cost-effective conditions and use the equipment or services individually.

[2] The Federal Council may decree regulations relating to unbundling in so far as this is necessary to safeguard diversity of opinion.

# [Title 4 Reception of Programme Services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#tit_4)

[**Art. 66** Free programme service reception](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_66) 

Everyone is free to receive programme services broadcast within Switzerland and from abroad if they are intended for a general audience.

[**Art. 67** Cantonal bans on antennas](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_67) 

[1] The cantons may in specific areas prohibit the erection of outdoor antennas if:


|    a. this is necessary for the protection of significant local and national landscapes, historical sites or natural and art monuments; and  
|    b. reception of the customary programme services in the region remains guaranteed under acceptable conditions.

[2] The erection of an outdoor antenna for the reception of additional programme services must be approved by way of exception if the interest in receiving the programme services overrides the interest in protecting the local and national landscape.

Such data may be stored by third parties in encrypted form (content encryption). Data may only be decrypted by the collection agency. Persons entrusted with servicing, maintenance or programming tasks may process such data within the information system if this is required in order to carry out their tasks and data security is guaranteed. In doing so, the content of the data may not be modified.

[3] Turnover in terms of paragraph 1 is defined as the total turnover excluding VAT achieved by an undertaking that must be declared in accordance with the VATA, irrespective of whether it qualifies for VAT liability. Where group taxation applies, the total turnover of the VAT group is decisive.

[4] The Federal Council shall specify the minimum turnover at a level that ensures that small undertakings are exempt from the fee.

[5] The amount of the fee is determined by the turnover. The Federal Council shall specify several turnover levels with a separate tariff for each level (tariff categories).

[1] The FTA collects the fee.

[2] Each year, when assessing the liability to pay VAT, the FTA shall allocate each undertaking liable to pay the fee to a tariff category and invoice it for the fee.

[3] If an undertaking has made no VAT returns or its returns are clearly inadequate, the FTA shall use its discretion to allocate the undertaking to a tariff category.

[4] If allocation to a tariff category for the tax period ending in the previous calendar year is temporarily impossible, the FTA shall invoice the fee when the tariff category has been determined.

[**Art. 70***b* Due date and enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/150/en#art_70_b) 

[1] The fee becomes due for payment 60 days after it is invoiced and the debt prescribes five years after the due date. In the event of late payment, default interest of 5 per cent per annum becomes due without prior notice.

[2] If a person liable to pay the fee files an objection in debt enforcement proceedings, the FTA shall issue a ruling on the amount of the fee due and at the same time dismiss the objection in accordance with Article 79 DEBA.

[3] In the event of any dispute, the ranking of creditors is postponed until an enforceable ruling has been issued.

[4] Any fees that are due or have been invoiced may be offset against refunds of VAT.

[5] Security for the fee is governed by Articles 93–95 VATA. Joint liability and succession to liability are governed by Articles 15 and 16 VATA.
