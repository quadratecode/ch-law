|    11. *SIM (Subscriber Identity Module):* smart card or chip permanently built into to the terminal device on which the IMSI and the related key are securely stored; the SIM is used to authenticate the subscribers to a mobile network, and includes the *USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module), UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit Card)* and *eSIM (embe**d**ded SIM)*;  
|    12. *ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier):* series-number of a built-in chip (e.g. eSIM) or of a smart card (e.g. SIM card) that uniquely identifies the chip;  
|    13. *IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity):* number that allows the unique international identification of mobile communication subscribers;  
|    14. *IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity):* number that allows the unique international identification of mobile communication terminals;  
|    15. *MAC address (Media Access Control Address):* hardware address that is stored in a network card or a network adapter and that is used as the unique address at the level of OSI layer 2;  
|    16. *PUK code (Personal Unblocking Key):* unchangeable PIN assigned to the SIM used to unblock the SIM if the PIN code has been entered incorrectly on several occasions;  
|    17. *PUK2-Code (Personal Unblocking Key 2):* same as the PUK code, but assigned to the PIN2 code;  
|    18. *NAT (Network Address Translation):* procedure for translating network addresses. The address information in IP packages is automatically replaced with other address information by a network element (e.g. router);  
|    19. *Source IP address:* IP address that is assigned to the communication end point (normally the client) that establishes the connection;  
|    20. *Port number:* address of a port; a port is the logical end point for communications with or within a computer system. A port is linked to an IP address and the communication protocol type;  
|    21. *Source port number:* port number that is assigned to the communication end point (normally the client) that establishes the connection;  
|    22. *Destination IP address:* IP address that is assigned to the communication end point (normally the server) with which the connection is established;  
|    23. *Destination port number:* port number that is assigned to the communication end point (normally the server) with which the connection is established;  
|    24. *SIP (Session Initiation Protocol):* communication protocol that is used for signalling and maintaining multimedia communication sessions;  
|    25. *SIP URI (SIP Uniform Resource Identifier):* URI scheme for addressing the SIP. The SIP URI are addressing elements in the format *user@domain.tld*;  
|    26. *IMPU (IP Multimedia Public Identity):* in addition to the IMPI, a subscriber to the IMS has one or more IMPUs that are used to communicate with other subscribers. One IMPI may be assigned several IMPUs. Conversely an IMPU may also be shared with other subscribers;  
|    27. *TEL URI (Telephone Uniform Resource Identifier):* URI scheme for telephone numbers. The TEL URI are addressing elements in the format *tel:number*, e.g. *tel:+41-868-868-868*;  
|    28. *IMPI (IP Multimedia Private Identity):* globally unique identifier, assigned by providers to their subscribers, which is used inter alia for registration and AAA events. Every subscriber to IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS) has an IMPI. The IMS is telecommunications system based on the internet protocol that integrates mobile voice services and internet functions;  
|    29. *Alias address:* additional email address that the subscriber can set up, change and delete at will. The email provider determines the maximum number of alias addresses and their structure. The alias addresses are linked to the email account. An email sent to an alias address is delivered to the same email box as used for the subscriber’s related main email address;  
|    30. *Mailing list:* list of email addresses, also known as a distribution list or distribution group. The list has its own email address. The messages that are sent to the mailing list address are forwarded on to the email addresses of its members;  
|    31. *Messaging services:* message transmitting services that are independent of from telephony and multimedia services. They include instant messaging, IMS messaging and messaging applications (apps) and SMS services from third-party providers (i.e. SMS services not provided by the subscriber’s TSP). These services may also include additional functions such as multimedia communication, data transmission and presence information (e.g. a subscriber can see the current status and potentially the location of the other subscribers);  
|    32. *Cloud-services:* derived communications services such as storage services and applications that are available online and hosted in data centres around the world depending on the need for resources;  
|    33. *Proxy services:* communication interface in a network. It works as an intermediary that accepts requests on one side in order to establish a connection via its own address with the other side. Proxy services are therefore relevant for the purposes of identification;  
|    34. *Public WLAN access point:* public wireless access point to a public telecommunications network that can be found both in public and in private spaces;  
|    35. *CGI (Cell Global Identity):* unmodified cell identifier in second and third generation mobile networks (2G and 3G) (see 3GPP TS 23.003, Clause 4.3.1);   
|    36. *ECGI (E-UTRAN Cell Global Identity):* unmodified cell identifier in fourth generation mobile networks (4G) (see 3GPP TS 23.003, Clause 19.6);  
|    37. *SAI (Service Area Identity):* unmodified identifier for a service area that is used in mobile networks for mobility management (see 3GPP TS 23.003, Clause 12.5);

|    41. *Target ID:* identifier under surveillance, i.e. the identifier of the target of the surveillance;  
|    42. *AAA (authentication, authorisation and accounting) information:* information on which subscribers are allowed to use which services and which is used to bill subscribers for service usage. For the purposes of this Ordinance, passwords are not regarded as AAA information. Authentication is the process by which a subscriber is identified before the access is granted. Authorisation determines which rights of access to resources or services that a subscriber holds and also guarantees access control. The subscriber’s use of resources is measured for accounting purposes;  
|    43. *SMS (Short Message Service):* messaging service for transmitting short text messages;  
|    44. *Voice mail:* storage devices used in telecommunication networks that offer answering services (e.g. receiving, forwarding and storing voice messages). There are also extensions for various types of media and services, such as SMS, email, fax or video messages as well as function extensions such as converting from one type of media to another and the sending of messages;  
|    45. *RCS (Rich Communications Services):* (originally: Rich Communication Suite) specification of the international industry organisation for mobile telephony providers (GSM Association, GSMA) for the IMS based provision of interoperable (i.e. cross-provider and cross-terminal) multimedia services with extended functional scope. Various types of media (e.g. language, music, photographs, videos) and services (e.g. chat, chat groups, calls, multimedia messages, short messages, instant messages, presence information, transmission of files, address books) can be combined; the RCS services are provided to subscribers by their mobile telephony provider;  
|    46. *E.164 number:* telephone number in accordance with international numbering plan E.164 of the ITU-T;  
|    47. *DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency):* a signalling procedure, i.e. during a telephone conversation, signals can be sent by pressing the telephone keypad, for example to interact with answering machines or automatic voice response systems;  
|    48. *MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service):* messaging service for transmitting messages in different types of media (multimedia) in mobile networks.
