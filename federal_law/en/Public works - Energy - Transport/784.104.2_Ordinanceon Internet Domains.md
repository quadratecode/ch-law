|    b. the applicant belongs, at the time of submission of the registration application, to a category of persons entitled to request an allocation (eligibility);  
|    c. the requested designation belongs, at the time of submission of the registration application, to a category of designations which may be the subject of an allocation;  
|    d. the envisaged use complies with Swiss law; if the domain name is used to offer or advertise products or services, a headquarters and an actual administrative site or domicile in Switzerland are essential;  
|    e. the requested designation may legitimately be regarded as having an objective relationship with the applicant or the envisaged use of the domain name; this is in particular the case when the domain name meets one of the following conditions:  
|    1. it contains a designation to which the applicant has a claim under trademark law,  
|    2. it refers to a designation objectively linked to the State or to its activities which is required by the public body or the public law organisation concerned,  
|    3. it contains a geographical designation:  
|    – to which the applicant has a right or in which it has a legitimate interest,  
|    – to which it has a right or in which it has a legitimate interest in the public mind, or  
|    – that it is authorised to use by the public body or bodies or other organisations concerned,


|    4. it refers to a designation in which the applicant has a legitimate interest or which is associated with this applicant in the public mind;


|    f. the requested designation does not correspond to or is not related to a designation with a generic character, subject to the provisions relating to the naming mandate (Art. 56).

|    b. when it is clear, on the basis of brief examination, that the chosen designation infringes third-party trademark rights; otherwise, the merits of the rights to use the alphanumeric designations of domain names is not verified; disputes relating to trademark rights in relation to domain names are governed by civil law;  
|    c. when the characteristics or values which underlie the domain oppose such allocation.

3 In exceptional cases, the registry may allocate domain names which do not meet the particular conditions of allocation when the interest of this allocation for the Swiss community so justifies.

[**Art. 54**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/701/en#art_54)

[**Art. 55**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/701/en#art_55) [Eligibility and staggered opening](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/701/en#art_55)

|    a. demonstrate that it complies with the general and particular conditions imposed on the allocation of a domain name;  
|    b. demonstrate that it represents all or an important part of the community concerned with the requested designation or that its candidature benefits from the support of all or an important part of this community; guarantees of compliance with the principles of competitive neutrality, non-discrimination and transparency may be substituted for representation or support of the community if the name applied for does not refer to a specific community or the name applied for is not represented by an organised or constituted community;  
|    c. indicate the possible related domain names in German, French, Italian or English which it wishes to integrate into the naming mandate;  
|    d. demonstrate that the envisaged use of the domain name and the performances or services offered in connection with this name benefit the whole of the community concerned;   
|    e. demonstrate the manner in which it will ensure that the requirements provided for under Title 2 of the Trademark Protection Act of 28 August 1992 are complied with by all the products offered using a domain name the designation of which refers to a product, to its characteristics or to a category of products;  
|    f. demonstrate the extent to which its project provides added value for the community concerned and for the Swiss community;  
|    g. demonstrate that it meets the conditions prescribed by OFCOM for the quality of the domain name or of the desired project;  
|    h. provide a draft of a naming mandate.

4 The registry shall publish the candidatures. Other applicants may submit an application for this same domain name within the 20 days following publication.

5 In the event of a multiple candidature, the registry shall allocate the domain name to the candidate whose project provides added value for the community concerned and for the Swiss community that is clearly greater than that of the other projects.

6 If no project meets the requirement set out in paragraph 5 and the candidates cannot agree on a single or joint candidature, the registry shall decide on the allocation by drawing lots or holding an auction. The proceeds from the auction are paid into federal funds.

7 A domain name under a naming mandate is allocated for a specified term. It must be used.

8 The rules applicable to the supervision of persons that are delegated the registry function of a domain managed by the Confederation (Art. 40 to 43) apply by analogy to naming mandates, and in particular to their revocation.

9 The registry shall disclose naming mandates to third parties which request them; it may also make them available by a consultation procedure or publish them in another manner. The clauses and annexes containing confidential commercial information may not be communicated.

[**Art. 57** Allocation process](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/701/en#art_57) 

1 The registry shall examine any application for registration of a domain name and publishes them, unless the application manifestly does not meet the general and particular conditions for allocation. Other applicants may submit a registration application for this same domain name within the 20 days following publication.

2 In the event of a multiple application, the registry allocates the domain name concerned in the following order of priority:


|    a. in principle to the public body or to the public law organisation making the application when the latter is in competition with private applicants and the requested designation as such is of public interest;  
|    b. to the public body or public law organisation that intends to use the domain name concerned in a manner that provides added value which is manifestly greater for the Swiss community compared to the other envisaged uses; if no project satisfies this requirement and the public bodies or public law organisations submitting the application cannot agree on a single or joint candidature, the registry does not allocate the domain name;  
|    c. in principle to the applicant which has a right to a trademark corresponding to the domain name concerned when it is in competition with applicants not benefiting from such a right;  
|    d. to the highest bidder in an auction when the applicants have competing rights under trademark law to the domain name concerned, unless holding an auction appears inappropriate in light of all the circumstances or the applicants concerned; the proceeds from the auction are paid into federal funds;  
|    e. to the applicant which was first to submit a registration application when all the applicants constitute non-profit-making entities and effectively pursue such aims;  
|    f. to the applicant that intends to use the domain name concerned in a manner that provides added value which is manifestly greater for the Swiss community compared to the uses envisaged by the other applicants; if no project satisfies this requirement and the applicants cannot agree on a single or joint candidature, the registry decides on the allocation by drawing lots or holding an auction; the proceeds from the auction are paid into federal funds.

3 Subject to the prior examination under Article 53 paragraph 2 letter b, the registry does not verify the merits of the rights to use the alphanumeric denominations of domain names. Disputes relating to the trademark rights in relation to domain names are governed by civil law.

## [Section 4 Revocation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/701/en#chap_5/sec_4)

[**Art. 58**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2014/701/en#art_58) 

The registry may, on its own initiative or at the request of the registrar concerned, revoke the allocation of a domain name:


|    a. if it appears that a generic designation allocated as a domain name should have been allocated under a naming mandate; the beneficiary of the naming mandate shall pay the former holder compensation which includes all the costs of registration and management of the revoked domain name;  
|    b. if it is evident, on the basis of a brief examination, that the designation allocated as a domain name infringes a trademark right;  
|    c. if the domain name contains a geographical denomination which is of particular interest for all or part of the Swiss community and is required by a public body or another public law organisation; the latter pays the former holder compensation which includes all the costs of registration and management of the revoked domain name;  
|    d. if there is reason to believe that the holder has applied for the registration for the sole purpose of harming the reputation of the holder of a legitimate interest in this name or a connected name, or that of a product or service associated with this name in the mind of the public;  
|    e. if there is reason to believe that the holder has applied for the allocation for the purpose of profiting from the reputation of the holder of a legitimate interest in this name or in a name or product associated with this name in the mind of the public;  
|    f. if the characteristics or values which underlie the domain so require.

3 OFCOM shall monitor compliance by the public bodies concerned with the management principles prescribed in paragraph 2. If necessary, it shall stipulate the measures or requirements relating to the security and availability of the infrastructure and services necessary for the operation of the DNS and to prevent abuse of the data made available to the public.

4 If a public body which has acquired a generic domain has not laid down the necessary rules, it shall manage this domain in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance which govern the «.ch» domain.
