[4] Both funds are exempt from all direct federal, cantonal and communal taxes.

[5] The Federal Council shall regulate the details of the two funds; it specifies the basis for calculating the contributions, and defines the principles of their investment policy. It may also amalgamate the funds.

[**Art. 82** Securing the financing of other disposal activities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/723/en#art_82) 

[1] In accordance with Article 669 of the Code of Obligations, and based on the calculations of disposal costs by the Disposal Fund, owners of nuclear installations are required to establish reserves for disposal costs that arise prior to decommissioning.

[2] Furthermore, owners are required to:


|    a. submit their reserves plan to the authority designated by the Federal Council for approval;  
|    b. describe the assets in the reserves that are earmarked for covering disposal costs;  
|    c. submit an auditors’ report to the authority designated by the Federal Council concerning compliance with the reserves plan and the use of earmarked reserves.
