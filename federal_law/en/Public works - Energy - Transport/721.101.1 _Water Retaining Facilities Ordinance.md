|    b. the associated reservoir;  
|    c. auxiliary installations.

[2] Dams may take the following form:


|    a. concrete or masonry dams;  
|    b. embankment dams;  
|    c. river impoundments with their side embankments.

[3] A reservoir is a lake that is artificially formed by dams.

[4] Auxiliary installations are structures and equipment installed on the reservoir and dam that are required for the safe operation of a water retaining facility, e.g. relief and outlet works.

[5] The operator of a water retaining facility is the holder of the licence to put the facility into operation.

[**Art. 2** Water retaining facilities with high risk potential](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/704/en#art_2) 

(Art. 2 para. 2 let. a, WRFA)

[1] A high risk potential is deemed to exist if the collapse of a water retaining structure could endanger human lives and/or result in extensive property damage.

[2] The relevant cantonal authorities shall notify the federal supervisory authority (Swiss Federal Office of Energy, SFOE) about water retaining facilities which, in view of their size, are not governed by the provisions of the WRFA, but which could have a high risk potential.

[3] Operators of such facilities are obliged to provide the SFOE with all the documentation that is required for performing its assessment.

[4] Before it makes its decision, the SFOE shall consult the other cantons concerned.

[**Art. 3** Water retaining facilities without a high risk potential](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/704/en#art_3) 

(Art. 2 para. 2 let. b, WRFA)

[1] When submitting their application to exempt their water retaining facility from the scope of application of the WRFA, operators must submit all documentation that is required for assessing the risk potential.

[2] Before it makes its decision, the SFOE consults the cantons concerned.

[**Art. 4** Water retaining facilities on bodies of water bordering neighbouring countries](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/704/en#art_4) 

(Art. 4, WRFA)

[1] The SFOE specifies the safety requirements for the construction and operation of water retaining facilities on bodies of water bordering neighbouring countries, in cooperation with the relevant foreign supervisory authorities.

[2] For this purpose the SFOE shall as far as possible abide by the provisions of Swiss legislation on water retaining facilities, and in any case ensure a level of safety that is equivalent to that specified in the relevant legislation.
