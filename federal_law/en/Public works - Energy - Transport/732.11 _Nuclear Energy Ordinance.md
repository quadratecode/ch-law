[**Art. 7** Requirements concerning nuclear safety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#art_7) 

The following measures must be taken in order to guarantee nuclear safety. 


|    a. Established or proven high-quality processes, materials, technologies and organisational structures and processes must be used in connection with design, construction, commissioning and operation of nuclear installations. This applies especially to the areas of planning, manufacture, testing, operation, surveillance, maintenance, quality assurance, evaluation of operational experience feedback, ergonomic design as well as basic and advanced training and professional development.  
|    b. Any deviations from normal operation should be countered as far as possible by ensuring that the behaviour of the installation is self-regulating and fault-tolerant. Wherever possible, the behaviour of the installation must be inherently safe. The term «inherently safe» is understood to mean that a given system functions safely on its own, i.e. without the support of auxiliary systems.  
|    c. In order to deal with accidents, the installation must be designed in such a manner as to ensure that the surroundings are not exposed to impermissible radiological effects. For this purpose, the installation must be equipped with both passive and active safety systems.   
|    d. Additional technical, organisational and administrative measures must be taken to prevent and mitigate the consequences if harmful quantities of radioactive substances might be released in case of an accident

[**Art. 8** Requirements concerning measures to prevent accidents](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#art_8) 

[1] Preventive and protective measures must be taken to avoid accidents in nuclear installations that may originate either within (internal) or outside (external) the installation.

[2] Internal initiating events include reactivity disturbance, loss of coolant, loss of heat sink, fire, flooding, mechanical damage due to component failure, damage to cladding when handling fuel elements, failure of operating systems, unintentional activation or faulty functioning of safety systems, and mistakes made by personnel.

[3] External initiating events include earthquake, flooding, accidental crash of civil or military aircraft, squall, lightning strike, shock wave, fire, loss of off-site power, impairment or loss of external cooling water supply.

[4] For the design of a nuclear installation in accordance with Article 7 letter c, accidents within the meaning of paragraph 2 and accidents not triggered by natural events within the meaning of paragraph 3 must be classified by the frequency specified in Article 123 paragraph 2 RPO. In addition to the initiating event, an unrelated single failure must also be assumed. Proof must be provided that the requirements relating to maximum radiation doses in accordance with Article 123 paragraph 2 RPO are met.

[4bis] For the design of a nuclear installation in accordance with Article 7 letter c, in the case of accidents triggered by natural events in accordance with paragraph 3, the assumption shall be made of a natural event with a frequency of 10[‑3] per year and a natural event with a frequency of 10[‑4] per year. In addition to a natural event triggering the accident, a separate individual error shall be assumed. It must be demonstrated that the dose resulting from a single such event for members of the public: 


|    a. is no greater than 1 mSv in the case of a frequency of 10[-3] per year;  
|    b. is no greater than 100 mSv in the case of a frequency of 10[-4] per year.

[5] Proof must be provided by probabilistic analysis that there is adequate protection against beyond-design-basis accidents. For this purpose, the preventive and mitigating measures in accordance with Article 7 letter d may be taken into account.

6 The Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (the Department) shall define the hazard assumptions and associated evaluation criteria in an ordinance.

[**Art. 9** Requirements concerning security](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#art_9) 

[1] The protection of nuclear installations and nuclear material against sabotage, malicious acts and unauthorised removal must be based on the principle of defence in depth, which encompasses structural, technical, organisational, personnel and administrative measures.

[2] The principles for security zones and barriers and for the protection of nuclear installations, nuclear materials and radioactive waste are defined in Annex 2.

[3] The Department shall define the principles for hazard assumptions and for structural, technical, organisational and administrative security measures in an ordinance.

[**Art. 10** Basic principles for the design of nuclear power plants](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#art_10) 

[1] The following principles apply to nuclear power plants:


|    a. Safety functions must also remain effective even if a single failure occurs independently of an initiating event, and also if a component is not available due to maintenance or repair. Such separate single failures include the random failure of a component that results in its incapacity to perform its intended safety function. Subsequent failures arising from such random failures are also regarded as part of the original single failure.  
|    b. Wherever possible, safety functions must be implemented in accordance with the principles of redundancy and diversity. Redundancy refers to the existence of a larger number of functional devices than are required for fulfilling the intended safety function. Diversity refers to the use of different types of physical or technical principles.  
|    c. Redundant trains of safety systems installed for performing safety functions must as far as possible be independent of one another in terms of function and in terms of both mechanical and support systems such as instrumentation and control and provision of energy, cooling and ventilation.  
|    d. Each redundant train of a safety system installed for performing a safety function must as far as possible be spatially separated from the other trains.  
|    e. Redundant devices installed for performing safety functions must be testable, as far as possible in their entirety, or otherwise subdivided into the broadest possible subparts, both manually and through simulated automatic activation, including under emergency power supply.  
|    f. Safety functions must be automated so that, in the event of accidents in accordance with Article 8, no interventions important to safety by personnel are required during the first 30 minutes following the initiating event.  
|    g. The design of systems and components must take sufficient account of appropriate safety margins.  
|    h. As far as possible, systems should be designed to ensure safety-oriented system behaviour in the event of equipment failures.  
|    i. Preference must be given to passive rather than active safety functions.  
|    j. Work stations and processes for the operation and maintenance of the installation must be designed so that they take account of human capabilities and their limits.  
|    k. While ensuring the same degree of safety, preference must be given to measures to prevent accidents in accordance with Article 7 letter d over measures to mitigate their consequences.

[2] ENSI shall specify detailed design principles for light-water reactors in guidelines.

[**Art. 11** Design principles for deep geological repositories](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#art_11) 

[1] In order to guarantee long-term safety, the site for a deep geological repository must meet the following requirements:


|    a. sufficient extent of suitable host rock;  
|    b. favourable hydro-geological conditions;  
|    c. long-term geological stability.

[2] A deep geological repository must be designed to ensure that:


|    a. it complies by analogy with the principles of Article 10 paragraph 1;  
|    b. it guarantees long-term safety through multiple passive safety barriers;  
|    c. steps to ease surveillance and repairs of the repository, or for the recovery of the waste, in no way impair the effectiveness of the passive safety barriers after closure of the repository;  
|    d. it can be closed within a period of a few years.

[3] ENSI shall specify detailed design principles for deep geological repositories in guidelines.

[**Art. 12** Design principles for other nuclear installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#art_12) 

[1] Article 10 paragraph 1 applies by analogy to the design of nuclear installations other than nuclear power plants and deep geological repositories.

[2] An interim storage installation for radioactive waste must be designed to ensure that:


|    a. the suitability for disposal of the waste packages will not be impaired;  
|    b. sufficient storage capacity is available for the anticipated volume of waste.

[3] ENSI shall specify detailed design principles for individual types of nuclear installations in guidelines.

# [Annex 2](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_2)

(Art. 9, para. 2)

## [Principles for the security of nuclear installations, nuclear materials and radioactive waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_2/lvl_d1582e118)

### [1. Technical security of nuclear installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_2/lvl_d1582e118/lvl_1)

The arrangement of security zones, areas and barriers must be based on the following model:

![](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/20190201/en/html/image/image1.png)

The various security barriers perform the following functions:


|    – The vehicle barrier protects against attacks using vehicles and obstructs the transport of heavy arms or explosives through the no access zone to the perimeter.  
|    – The perimeter surrounds the protected area. It detects intruders, identifies the location of the attack and triggers the alarm.  
|    – Security barriers D, C and B provide increasingly higher levels of resistance towards the inner and vital area. They protect and surround the corresponding areas containing systems and equipment important to safety.

In the case of interim storage installations and deep geological repositories, ENSI shall decide whether it is possible to waive any security barriers.

Security systems (e.g. central alarm stations, guard-houses) that permit pedestrian or vehicle access to security zones must be located behind a barrier with the same level of resistance that is required for the protection of the corresponding zone.

The level of resistance of a barrier must be maintained, and for this reason, application of the two door interlock principle is required. If by way of exception it is necessary to deviate from or deactivate this method, access must be controlled by the security guards

### [2. Security of nuclear materials and radioactive waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_2/lvl_d1582e118/lvl_2)

#### [Categorisation of nuclear materials and radioactive waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_2/lvl_d1582e118/lvl_2/lvl_d1582e121)

#### [Category I](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_2/lvl_d1582e118/lvl_2/lvl_d1582e123)


Material in this category must be protected against unauthorised removal with extremely reliable systems as follows:

*Use and storage* within a highly protected inner area i.e. a protected zone for the type of material defined for category II, access to which is restricted to persons whose integrity has been verified, and which is surveyed by guard personnel who are in close contact with the relevant emergency crews. The aim of the various measures in this connection is to identify and prevent malicious acts unauthorised access and the unauthorised removal of nuclear material.

*Movement of nuclear material* in accordance with special precautionary measures for the described method for the transport of material in categories II and III, and under constant surveillance by accompanying personnel and under conditions that guarantee close contact with the relevant emergency crews.

#### [Category II](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_2/lvl_d1582e118/lvl_2/lvl_d1582e124)

*Use and storage* within a protected area access to which is monitored, i.e. a zone that is under constant surveillance by security personnel or electronic devices, and is surrounded by a physical perimeter with a limited number of adequately controlled points of access, or a zone with an equivalent level of physical protection.

*Movement of nuclear material* in accordance with special precautionary measures, including prior arrangements between sender, recipient and carrier, plus prior agreement between the legal entities subject to the jurisdiction and regulatory authorities of the country of origin and destination for cross-border transport, concerning the time, place and procedure for the transfer of responsibility for the consignment. 

#### [Category III](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_2/lvl_d1582e118/lvl_2/lvl_d1582e125)

*Use and storage* within a zone, access to which is under surveillance.

*Movement of nuclear material* in accordance with special precautionary measures, including prior arrangements between sender, recipient and carrier, plus prior agreement between the legal entities subject to the jurisdiction and regulatory authorities of the country of origin and destination for cross-border transport, concerning the time, place and procedure for the transfer of responsibility for the consignment.

### [B. Categorisation of events and findings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_6/lvl_A/lvl_B)

#### [1. Classification:](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_6/lvl_A/lvl_B/lvl_1)

Events and findings in terms of Article 21 paragraph 1 and Article 38 paragraph 3 letters a and c must be classified as follows: 



| Class | Criteria |
| **General Emergency** | An event that constitutes a serious current or projected radiological hazard to the environment and which mandatorily requires preparation for or the implementation of protective measures in the vicinity of nuclear installations. |
| **Site Area Emergency** | An event that could develop into a General Emergency or which constitutes a serious radiological hazard on the site area. A future (projected) radiological hazard to the environment that necessitates the deployment of the nuclear installation’s emergency team and external emergency services is possible. |
| **Alert** | An event that leads to a significant decrease in the level of protection for on-site personnel, or which could develop into an installation emergency or serious emergency and which, depending on the event, requires the deployment of all or part of the emergency team at the nuclear installation. |
| **Reportable Event** | An event or finding with significance for nuclear safety but which does not constitute an emergency (i.e. General Emergency, Site Area Emergency, or Alert). |

#### [2. Classification on the IAEA’s International Nuclear Event Scale (INES)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_6/lvl_A/lvl_B/lvl_2)

Events and findings in terms of Article 21 paragraph 1 and Article 38 paragraph 3 letters a and c must also be classified in accordance with the IAEA’s International Nuclear Event Scale (see INES User’s Manual 2008 Edition, IAEA, Vienna 2009).



| Level | Descriptor | Nature of events |
| 7 | Major accident | |    – External release of a large fraction of the radioactive material in the form of a mixture of short-lived and long-lived radioactive fission products (more than 50,000 TBq iodine-131 equivalent). |
| 6 | Serious accident | |    – External release of radioactive material (5,000 to 50,000 TBq iodene-131 equivalent). |
| 5 | Accident with off-site risk | |    – External release of radioactive material (500 to 5,000 TBq iodene-131 equivalent).|    – Severe damage to reactor core with release of large quantities of radioactivity within the installation. |
| 4 | Accident without significant off‑site risk | |    – Release of radioactive material that is above the permitted dose limits that may result in a dose of several millisieverts for those persons most exposed.|    – Partial damage to reactor core due to mechanical effects or melting.|    – Irradiation of personnel probably serious enough to lead to an acute death. |
| 3 | Serious incident | |    – Release of radioactive substances above the permitted dose limits resulting in a dose to the critical group of the order of a few tenths of millisieverts.|    – On-site events resulting in doses to workers sufficient to cause acute health effects and/or an event resulting in a severe spread of contamination within the installation.|    – Incidents in which a further failure of safety systems could lead to accident conditions, or a situation in which safety systems would be unable to prevent an accident if certain initiators were to occur. |
| 2 | Incident | |    – Event or finding with significant failure in safety provisions but with sufficient defence in depth remaining to cope with additional failures. These include events where the actual failures would be rated at level 1, but which reveal significant additional organizational inadequacies or safety culture deficiencies.|    – An event resulting in a dose to a worker exceeding a statutory annual dose limit and/or an event which leads to the presence of significant quantities of radioactivity in the installation in areas not expected by design.  |
| 1 | Anomaly | |    – Anomaly beyond the authorised regime. This may be due to equipment failure, human error or procedural inadequacies. Event or finding without direct safety consequences that reveal significant inadequacies in the organisa­tional system or safety culture.  |
| 0 | Deviation | |    – Events and findings where operational limits and conditions are not exceeded and which are properly managed in accordance with adequate procedures.Examples: a single random failure in a redundant system discovered during periodic inspections or tests, an automatic reactor trip proceeding normally, leakages within the operational limits; all examples with no significant correlation with safety culture. |

#### [3. Assessment of public interest](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/68/en#annex_6/lvl_A/lvl_B/lvl_3)


In the case of events and findings in terms of Article 21 paragraph 1 and Article 38 paragraph 3 letters a and c, and in the case of other events, an assessment must be made of whether there is a public interest.

Deadlines for notification and reporting:



|  | **Nuclear Safety** |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | **S**Serious incident | **A**Installation incident | **B**Alert | **M**Event subject to reporting requirement | **Ö**Public event |
