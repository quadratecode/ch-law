## [Section 1 Universal Service Licence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#chap_3/sec_1)

[**Art. 12** Granting the universal service licence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_12) 

[1] Universal service licences shall in all cases be put out to tender as a competition based on criteria.

[2] A bidder for a universal service licence must additionally submit in its concept the business plan for the entire term of the licence, indicating the assumed prices and the envisaged investments.

[3] The universal service licence shall be granted to the bidder who meets the decision-making criteria and who does not request financial compensation. When several bidders meet the criteria and do not request financial compensation, the licence is granted to the bidder who best satisfies the criteria employed for qualitative evaluation.

[4] When all the bidders who meet the criteria request financial compensation, the one whose bid offers the best ratio between the result of the qualitative evaluation and the required compensation shall receive the licence.

[5] The Federal Communications Commission (ComCom) shall call on one or more telecommunications service providers to assure the universal service when:


|    a. it is apparent from the outset that the invitation to tender cannot take place under competitive conditions;  
|    b. the invitation to tender has not produced any candidates;  
|    c. the invitation to tender did not take place under competitive conditions, in particular when only one bid was submitted;  
|    d. at the end of the tender no bidder meets the criteria.

[6] The licensee designated on the basis of paragraph 5 may request financial compensation.

[7] The new universal service licence shall be granted six months at the latest before the expiry of the licence in force.

[**Art. 13** Financial compensation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_13) 

[1] The financial compensation serves exclusively to finance the uncovered costs of the universal service.

[2] The uncovered costs are equivalent to the net total costs of the universal service. The net total costs are equivalent to the difference between the costs to the company providing the universal service and the costs it would incur if it did not have to provide the universal service.

[**Art. 14** Calculation of net total costs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_14) 

[1] The net costs of the universal service are equivalent to the expenses incurred by an efficient provider in ensuring the universal service. The net costs, which are listed in itemised form for each service, are calculated using the following principles:


|    a. the calculation is performed on a current basis;  
|    b. the network costs are assessed using book values;  
|    c. the capital yield on investments is that typical of the sector, and must be weighted with the risk associated with the provision of the universal service;  
|    d. the depreciation method takes the lifetime of the investments into account; this must correspond to their economic lifetime;  
|    e. direct and indirect revenues must be subtracted from the costs.

[2] The net total costs of the universal service are equivalent to the sum of the net costs assessed separately for the individual services following deduction of intangible advantages.

[3] The data used for the calculation must be supported, i.e. it must be transparent and must derive from dependable sources. For this purpose, the professional recommendations on the presentation of accounts (FER), the internationally recognised accounting standards (IAS) or comparable internationally recognised accounting guidelines must be applied.

## [Section 3 Financing the Universal Service](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#chap_3/sec_3)

[**Art. 24** Setting the financial compensation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_24) 

[1] The net total costs are calculated on the basis of the principles contained in Article 14.

[2] The provisional costs must be submitted to OFCOM by 31 July of the year prior to that for which the budget has been prepared. If the universal service licence is put out to tender, the anticipated costs for the first two years of the licence shall be set out directly in the universal service licensee’s application.

[3] The actual costs must be submitted to OFCOM two months following the end of the year at the latest. The universal service licensee must provide OFCOM with all data necessary for monitoring the actual costs.

[4] ComCom shall establish the amount of the financial compensation on the basis of the actual costs. The differences between the provisional and actual costs must be conclusively substantiated in order to be the object of a claim for compensation.

[5] The licensee shall advance the annual financial compensation. Interest is charged on the advance at a rate which applies for federal obligations with the same or a comparable term at the time of the compensation.

[6] OFCOM may demand an audit of the bookkeeping data and cost calculations.

[7] If the licensee does not submit the required information within twelve months of the year-end, any claim to a contribution lapses.

[**Art. 25** Fees for the financing of the universal service](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_25) 

[1] The decisive factor in calculating the fee for a registered provider of telecommunications services is its turnover in the telecommunications services offered in the country minus the costs of the telecommunications services which it has purchased wholesale from third-party providers and the costs of telecommunications services billed to third parties.

[2] Telecommunications service providers shall provide OFCOM with information on the previous year’s turnover by 30 April at the latest, and for the first time in 2009.

[3] If a provider does not submit the data necessary for calculation of the fees, OFCOM shall make its calculation on the basis of the total turnover subject to value-added tax.

[4] OFCOM may provide for an external monitoring system to test the accuracy of the data provided by telecommunications service providers.

[5] If a defaulting provider does not pay the amounts it owes within one year of the period set in the reminder, these are carried forward to the net total costs of the period following this appraisal. The transfer does not cancel the payment obligation. Amounts which are subsequently paid are transferred to the facility which the financing mechanism manages and deducted from the net total costs for the period following receipt of the payment.

[6] Providers with a definitive annual turnover (para. 1) of less than five million francs are exempt from the fee.

[7] OFCOM shall issue administrative regulations for determining turnover and the information necessary for apportioning costs.

# [Chapter 7 Access to the Facilities and Services of Dominant Providers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#chap_7)


## [Section 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#chap_7/sec_1)

[**Art. 51**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_51) [Rights](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_51) 

All telecommunications service providers are entitled to have access to the facilities and services of the provider with a dominant position in the market (the «dominant provider»).

[**Art. 52** Non-discrimination](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_52) 

[1] The dominant provider shall allow other providers access to the facilities, services and the corresponding information without discrimination.

[2] Other providers must not be treated less favourably than business units, subsidiaries or other partners of the dominant provider.

[2bis] The difference between the access prices offered by the dominant provider and its end customer prices must allow a comparable, efficient provider to achieve cost-covering revenues.

[3] The dominant provider may provide only the technical reserves that are necessary for current operation, maintenance and replacement of its own installations. On request it must allow other providers to inspect its installations and where applicable justify in writing why the capacities are not sufficient.

[4] It shall process the orders of other providers immediately in the order in which they are received. It may reject an order if there are well-founded doubts that it corresponds to the actual requirements of the other provider.

[**Art. 53** Transparency](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_53) 

[1] The dominant provider shall publish an updated reference offer for access to its facilities and services at least once a year. It shall present the derivation of the individual prices in a summarised and comprehensible form.

[2] It must give notice of changes in the reference offer at least three months in advance.

[3] It provides other providers with up-to-date online information as required for the individual forms of access and their co-location and enables online standardised ordering, processing, operation and cancellation of the individual access and co-location services.

[4] If the dominant provider makes technical or operational changes to the access and co-location services after the order that are disadvantageous to the other provider, it shall give adequate notice of these. If the changes involve substantial costs to the provider concerned, the period of notice shall be at least 24 months. Changes may be made at any time with the agreement of the other provider.

[5] The dominant provider regularly publishes statistics on the access and co-location services it provides, with the relevant details of demand, actual availability and delivery periods. If services are comparable, it compares the details relating to its own customers with those for other providers.

[**Art. 54**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_54) [Cost-oriented pricing: Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_54) 

[1] The access prices may as a maximum be the costs causally linked to granting access to services and facilities in accordance with Article 11 paragraph 1 TCA (the relevant costs).

[2] Unless otherwise provided, the calculation is based on the costs incurred by an efficient provider on a forward-looking basis and are governed by the following rules:


|    a. The costs correspond to the replacement costs of modern equivalent assets (MEAs).  
|    b. Account shall be taken of the long-term additional costs of the network components used and the long-term additional costs incurred solely due to access services (the long run incremental costs, LRIC).  
|    c. The relevant pro rata joint costs shall be added, as well as a constant mark-up for common costs.  
|    d. A return, at the rate customary in the sector, on the capital used for investments is also added.

[3] Access services must be charged and billed separately from other services.

[**Art. 54***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_54_a) [Cost-oriented pricing: Valuation of cable ducts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_54_a) 

[1] The costs of the cable ducts are determined based on the costs incurred by the dominant provider for maintaining and modifying the cable ducts.

[2] The depreciation costs correspond to the average of the investments in the cable duct infrastructure that have been made and that are planned over an appropriate number of years (the infrastructure maintenance and modification ratio). They are expressed for one calendar year.

[3] The dominant provider's capital cost rate is used to calculate the imputed interest on the capital invested.

[4] The invested capital is the average capital employed; this is calculated according to the following rules:


|    a. In the first calculation year, the average capital employed is calculated by, reducing half of replacement investment made by an efficient provider in the cable duct infrastructure by the infrastructure maintenance and modification ratio and increasing it by the investments made by the dominant provider in the previous year.  
|    b. In the following years, the average capital employed is calculated by indexing the previous year value using a averaged production cost index for the categories of utility line and surfacing construction work in a ratio of 7:3; this value is then reduced by the infrastructure maintenance and modification ratio and increased by the investments made by the dominant provider in the previous year.

[**Art. 54***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_54_b) [Cost-oriented pricing: lower price limit](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_54_b) 

[1] A lower price limit applies to the access prices calculated in accordance with Articles 54 and 54*a*.

[2] The lower price limit corresponds to the costs to an efficient provider comprising the short-term additional costs of network components used, the short-term additional costs incurred solely due to access services, and the joint and common costs (short run incremental costs plus, SRIC+).

[**Art. 54***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_54_c) [Cost-oriented pricing: price-related discrimination](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_54_c) 

If the application of Articles 54–54*b* fails to generate cost-covering revenues in accordance with Article 52 paragraph 2[bis], the relevant access prices shall be calculated by reducing the turnovers that the dominant provider achieves with the end customer services provided on the basis of the form of access concerned by the downstream costs of providing these services and thereafter breaking the results down into a single unit (retail minus).

[**Art. 55**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_55) [Interfaces](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_55) 

[1] OFCOM shall publish a list of recommended interfaces for access and their technical specifications. Internationally harmonised interfaces shall be given priority.

[2] Other providers may demand from the dominant provider the interfaces recommended by OFCOM or the interfaces that the dominant provider uses for its own services. In addition, they may demand interfaces from the dominant provider if these:


|    a. correspond to international harmonisation;  
|    b. can be implemented technically; and   
|    c. represent a substantial economic advantage for the planned introduction of services.

[**Art. 56** Principles of co-location](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_56) 

[1] At all sites necessary for access, the dominant provider shall offer other providers the possibility of using the site and putting in and operating installations there, in a non-discriminatory manner.

[2] When it does so, it allows other providers in particular:


|    a. to access the site under the same conditions, particularly with regard to access routes, access times and accompaniment, as the dominant provider;  
|    b. to connect different forms of access in the co-location premises;  
|    c. to connect their installations at the site with their networks via the same types of feed as is possible for the dominant provider, and in all cases via radio relay;  
|    d. to connect their installations at the site to those of third-party providers;  
|    e. to acquire access services for third-party providers.

[3] The offering shall consist at least of use of the site without constructional separation.

[4] Other providers shall immediately release co-location areas that have not been used for at least three months in the event of a shortage of space.

[**Art. 57** Co-location in the case of a shortage of space](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_57) 

[1] If the co-location area is not sufficient given optimal use of the available space, the dominant provider shall provide additional space at its location.

[2] If, as a result, co-location cannot be assured for the other provider under conditions which are reasonable for the dominant provider, the latter shall operate the other provider’s installations under the same technical and operational conditions as it operates its own installations, or it shall tolerate the other provider putting in and operating installations in premises adjacent to the site or nearby, and enable it to connect these installations to the dominant provider’s network.

[3] The other provider shall decide which of the variants in accordance with paragraph 2 is chosen, within the framework of technical feasibility.

## [Section 2 Special Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#chap_7/sec_2)

[**Art. 58** Fully unbundled access to the local loop](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_58) 

[1] In its reference offer, the dominant provider shall publish the technical and commercial conditions for fully unbundled access to the local loop, in particular:


|    a. the modalities for the use of the unbundled local loop or a partial section, in each case without upstream connection of transmission or switching technology;  
|    b. the specifications of the relevant interfaces;  
|    c. the specifications of the physical access to distributors;  
|    d. the specifications of network compatibility.

[2] It shall constantly examine internationally standardised technologies that correspond to the state of the art for network compatibility. It shall provide the available spectrum in the copper-based access network in a technology-neutral and non-discriminatory manner, taking account of interference-free operation. 

[3] If the calculation of the replacement costs of modern equivalent assets under Article 54 paragraph 2 letter a relates to new technology no longer based on the twisted metallic pair, then in calculating the price, the difference in value between the modern equivalent assets and the assets based on the twisted metallic pair must be taken into account. In doing so, the following applies:


|    a. The difference in value between the assets is derived from the difference in the revenues that can be achieved in the end customer market, taking account of the difference in the variable downstream costs.  
|    b. The different potential revenues and the variable downstream costs relate to the services and bundles of services that are provided by the different assets.  
|    c. A quotient must be obtained from the various values, the numerator of which is the value of the assets based on the twisted metallic pair and the denominator of which is the value of the modern equivalent assets (quotient method).  
|    d. The replacement costs are calculated by multiplying the quotient by the replacement costs of the modern equivalent assets.

[4] In the case of access to a partial section, the dominant provider may keep free the reserve space in its installations with distribution equipment which it needs to meet its expected customers’ demand in the near future for services provided via the distribution installation. On request, it shall disclose the expected demand and the reserve space and provide justification for these.

|    b. the specifications of the interconnection interfaces used and the signalling protocols.

[2] The dominant provider of the public telephony service shall provide at least the following interconnection services:


|    a. originating, terminating and transit of connections;  
|    identification of the calling line, identification of the connected line, and suppression of this information;   
|    c. access to the value-added services 08xx and 09xx;  
|    d. the physical connection between the telecommunication installations of different providers as required for the connection of services.

[3] In addition to minute and call-based access prices, the dominant provider shall offer capacity-based access prices (capacity based charges) based on the maximum bandwidth used by the interconnection partner.

[4] If the calculation of the replacement costs of modern equivalent assets in accordance with Article 54 paragraph 2 letter a is based on new technology that is significantly different from the previously used technology, the following applies:


|    a. When the price is calculated for the first time, the costs in accordance with Article 54 paragraph 2 shall be based two thirds on the last-used previous assets and one third on the new assets.  
|    b. In the following year, the costs in accordance with Article 54 paragraph 2 shall be based one third on the last-used previous assets and two thirds on the new assets.  
|    c. In the following years, the costs in accordance with Article 54 paragraph 2 shall be based in their entirety on the new assets.

[**Art. 62** Leased lines](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/166/en#art_62) 

1 In its reference offer, the dominant provider shall publish the technical and commercial conditions for leased lines, in particular:


|    a. the technical specifications of leased lines;  
|    b. the technical specifications for access and termination points;  
|    c. the specifications of the interfaces.

[2] If the calculation of the replacement costs of modern equivalent assets in accordance with Article 54 paragraph 2 letter a is based on new technology that is significantly different from the previously used technology, the following applies:


|    a. When the price is calculated for the first time, the costs in accordance with Article 54 paragraph 2 shall be based two thirds on the last-used previous assets and one third on the new assets.
