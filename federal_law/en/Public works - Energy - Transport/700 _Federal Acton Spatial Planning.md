# Federal Acton Spatial Planning

## (Spatial Planning Act, SPA)

of 22 June 1979 (Status as of 1 January 2019)

The Federal Assembly of the Swiss Confederation,

on the basis of Articles 22[quater] and 34[sexies] of the Federal Constitution, and having considered the Federal Council dispatch dated 27 February 1978

decrees:

# [Title 1 Introduction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#tit_1)

[**Art. 1** Aims](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_1) 

[1] The Confederation, cantons and communes shall ensure that the land is used economically and that building areas are separate from the areas where building is not permitted. They shall coordinate their activities that have a spatial impact and implement a system of settlements that ensures the desired development of the country. They shall take account of the natural environment and of the needs of the population and the economy.

[2] By means of spatial and regional planning measures, they shall in particular support efforts to:


|    a. protect natural resources such as soil, air, water, forests and the landscape;  
|    a[bis]. promote inward settlement development, while ensuring an appropriate quality of housing;  
|    b. create compact settlements;   
|    b[bis]. create and maintain the regional requirements for the economy;  
|    c. encourage social, economic and cultural life in the various regions of the country, and promote appropriate decentralisation of settlement and economic activities;  
|    d. guarantee the basis for the provision of sufficient food supplies for the country;  
|    e. ensure the general defence of the country;  
|    f. promote the integration of foreigners and social cohesion.

[**Art. 2** Planning obligation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_2) 

[1] The Confederation, cantons and communes shall plan their activities that have a spatial impact, and coordinate their planning efforts.

[2] They shall take account of the spatial impact of their other activities.

[3] Authorities responsible for planning shall ensure that subordinate authorities are given the necessary freedom to fulfil their remit.

[**Art. 3** Planning principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_3) 

[1] Authorities responsible for planning shall take account of the following principles:

[2] The countryside must be preserved. In particular:


|    a. sufficient areas of suitable arable land, in particular crop rotation areas, should be reserved for agriculture;  
|    b. settlements, buildings and installations should integrate well into the landscape;  
|    c. lakesides and riverbanks should be kept free and accessible to the public;  
|    d. natural landscapes and recreational areas should be conserved;  
|    e. forests should be able to fulfil their functions.

[3] Settlements must be arranged according to the needs of their inhabitants and their expansion must be limited. In particular:


|    a. residential and working areas should be suitably located adjacent to each other and mainly planned in locations that are adequately served by public transport;  
|    a[bis]. measures should be taken to make better use of unused or insufficiently used areas in building zones and of opportunities to consolidate the settlement area;  
|    b. residential areas should as far as possible be protected from harmful emissions or nuisances such as air pollution, noise or vibration;  
|    c. cycle-paths and footpaths should be created and maintained;  
|    d. favourable conditions for the supply of goods and services should be ensured;  
|    e. settlements should contain numerous open spaces and trees.

[4] Appropriate locations must be chosen for buildings and installations which are public, or in the public interest. In particular:


|    a. regional needs should be considered and undesirable disparities reduced;  
|    b. facilities such as schools, recreational centres and public services should be easily accessible to inhabitants;  
|    c. adverse impacts on the natural environment, the population and the economy should be avoided or minimised.

[**Art. 4** Provision of information and participation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_4) 

[1] The authorities responsible for planning shall inform the public of the objectives and progress of planning under this Act.

[2] They shall ensure that the public are able to participate adequately in the planning process.

[3] Plans under this Act shall be made available for public inspection.

[**Art. 5** Compensation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_5) 

[1] Cantonal legislation shall regulate appropriate compensation procedures for major advantages and disadvantages resulting from planning under this Act.

[1bis] Planning advantages shall be compensated for at a rate of at least 20 per cent. Compensation becomes due on the development or disposal of the parcel of land. Cantonal law shall organise the compensation system at least so as to compensate for the added value attributable to permanently assigning land to a building zone.

[1ter] The proceeds shall be used for measures under paragraph 2 or for other spatial planning measures under Article 3, in particular paragraphs 2 letter a and 3 letter a[bis].

[1quater] In calculating the charge, the planning advantage resulting from being assigned to a building zone shall be reduced by the amount paid within a reasonable period to acquire a replacement agricultural building for personal use.

[1quinquies] Cantonal law may waive the charge if:


|    a. a local authority would be liable to pay; or   
|    b. the anticipated income from the charge does not justify the cost of its collection.

[1sexies] The charge paid may be deducted from the gain as an allowable expense when calculating any capital gains tax on land.

[2] Full compensation shall be paid if planning activities lead to restrictions of title which amount to expropriation.

[3] The cantons may require that the payment of compensation in the case of restrictions of title must be entered in the Land Register.

The structure plan shall designate suitable areas and stretches of water that may be used to generate renewable energies.

[**Art. 9** Binding character and amendments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_9) 

[1] Structure plans are binding on the authorities.

[2] If circumstances change, new tasks arise or if a generally better solution is possible, structure plans shall be reviewed and, if necessary, amended.

[3] As a rule, structure plans shall be comprehensively reviewed every ten years and, if necessary, revised.

[**Art. 10**  Responsibilities and procedures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_10) 

[1] The cantons shall determine responsibilities and procedures.

[2] They shall regulate the way in which communes, other bodies responsible for activities which have a spatial impact and organisations for environmental protection and for the protection of nature and cultural heritage that have a right to appeal in accordance with Article 55 of the Environmental Protection Act of 7 October 1983 and with Article 12 of the Federal Act of 1 July 1966 on the Protection of Nature and Cultural Heritage (NCHA) cooperate in drawing up the structure plans.

## [Chapter 3 Land Use Plans](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#tit_2/chap_3)

### [Section 1 Purpose and Content](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_1)

[**Art. 14** Definition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_14) 

[1] Land use plans govern the permissible use of land.

[2] They shall designate in advance building zones, agricultural zones and protected zones.

[**Art. 15**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_15) [Building zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_15) 

[1] Building zones must be defined in such a manner that they meet the anticipated needs for the following 15 years.

[2] Excessively large building zones must be reduced in size.

[3] The location and size of the building zones must be defined in a manner not restricted by communal boundaries, respecting the aims and principles of spatial planning. In particular, crop rotation areas must be maintained and nature and landscape preserved.

[4] Land may be assigned to a building zone for the first time if:


|    a. it is suitable for development;  
|    b. it will probably also be needed, made ready for development and developed within the next 15 years even though internal use reserves in existing building areas have been exploited to their full potential;  
|    c. arable land is not fragmented as a result;  
|    d. its availability is guaranteed by law; and  
|    e. the requirements of the structure plans are met thereby.

[5] The Confederation and cantons shall together draw up technical guidelines for assigning land to building zones, and in particular for calculating the area required.

[**Art. 15***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_15_a) [Availability of building land](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_15_a) 

[1] The cantons shall work with the communes to take the measures that are required in order that building zones are used for their assigned purpose, in particular measures required under land law such as land reorganisation projects (Art. 20).

[2] Where it is in the public interest to do so, cantonal law shall provide that the competent authority set a deadline for the development of a parcel of land and can order specific measures if the deadline expires without development taking place.

[**Art. 16**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_16) [Agricultural zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_16) 

[1] Agricultural zones shall ensure the long-term use of the land for food, the conservation of the countryside, of recreational areas and of the ecological balance. They shall be kept largely undeveloped, according to their various functions. Agricultural zones shall include land which:


|    a. is suitable for agricultural or horticultural use and is required to fulfil the various agricultural tasks; or   
|    b. should be used for agricultural purposes in the general interest.

[2] Wherever possible, agricultural zones shall be demarcated as large and continuous areas.

[3] The cantons shall take appropriate account of the various functions of the agricultural zones in their planning activities.

[**Art. 16***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_16_a) [Buildings and installations conforming to zone requirements in agricultural zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_16_a) 

[1] Buildings and installations shall conform to zone requirements if they are required for agricultural or horticultural use. This is without prejudice to the narrower definition of zone conformity in the context of Article 16 paragraph 3. 

[1bis] A permit may be granted for buildings and installations at an agricultural concern that are required for the production of energy from biomass or for connected composting facilities on the basis that they conform to zone requirements if the processed biomass is closely linked to the agricultural operations and to the operations at the location. Permits must be made conditional on the buildings or installations being used only for the permitted purpose. The Federal Council shall regulate the details.

[2] Buildings and installations that serve the internal expansion of an agricultural or horticultural concern are in conformity with zone requirements. The Federal Council shall regulate the details.

[3] Buildings and installations that serve a purpose beyond the internal expansion of an agricultural or horticultural concern may be deemed to conform to zone requirements if they are to be constructed in an exempted area within the agricultural zone, as determined by the canton in a planning procedure.

[**Art. 16***a*[bis]](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_16_a) [Buildings and installations for keeping and using horses](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_16_a) 

[1] Buildings and installations that are required for keeping horses shall be authorised as conforming to zone requirements if they form part of an existing agricultural business as defined in the Federal Act of 4 October 1991 on Rural Land Rights, provided the business produces most of its own fodder and has pastures for keeping horses.

[2] A permit may be granted for areas with compacted ground where the horses kept by the business are used.

[3] A permit shall be granted for facilities directly related to using horses such as tack rooms or changing rooms.

[4] The Federal Council shall regulate the details.

[**Art. 16***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_16_b) [Prohibition of use and removal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_16_b)

[1] Buildings and installations that are no longer used for purposes conforming to zone requirements and for which usage in terms of Articles 24–24*e* is not permitted may no longer be used. This prohibition shall cease to apply as soon as they can again be used in conformity with zone requirements.

[2] If authorisation is granted for a limited period or subject to a condition subsequent, the buildings and installations must be removed when authorisation ceases to apply, and the location must be restored to its previous state.

[**Art. 17** Protection zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_17) 

[1] Protection zones shall include:


|    a. streams, rivers, lakes and their shores and banks;  
|    b. landscapes of special beauty, and countryside of natural, cultural or historical value;  
|    c. important sites of local character, historic sites, as well as natural or cultural monuments;  
|    d. habitats for protected animals and plants.

[2] Instead of defining protection zones, cantonal legislation may provide for other suitable measures.

[**Art. 18** Other zones and areas](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_18) 

[1] Cantonal legislation may provide for other land use zones.

[2] It may contain regulations concerning areas for which no use has yet been determined or for which a specific use will be permitted only at a later date.

[3] Forested areas shall be defined and protected by forestry legislation.

[**Art. 18***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_18_a) [Solar installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_18_a) 

[1] In construction and agricultural zones, solar panels on roofs which are sufficiently unobtrusive do not require a building permit in accordance with Article 22 paragraph 1. The competent authorities must merely be notified of such installations.

[2] Cantonal law may:


|    a. determine specific, less aesthetically sensitive types of building zone in which other solar installations may also be erected without planning permission;   
|    b. require a building permit in clearly described types of protection zone.

[3] Solar installations on cultural and natural monuments of cantonal or national importance always require a building permit. They may not be detrimental to the monuments to any significant degree.

[4] In all other cases, in principle the interests of solar energy use on existing or new buildings outweigh aesthetic considerations.

[**Art. 19** Infrastructure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_19) 

[1] A parcel of land is regarded as ready for development when it has adequate access for its designated use and the necessary water supply, energy and wastewater facilities can be connected to nearby utility mains without considerable difficulty or expense.

[2] The local authority shall connect building zones to infrastructure within the period of time set in the development programme; where necessary, it may do so in stages. The contributions to be made by landowners are be determined under cantonal legislation.

[3] If the local authority does not connect building zones within the time limit, landowners must be permitted to connect their land themselves in accordance with the plans approved by the local authority or to advance funds for infrastructure connection by the local authority, in accordance with the provisions of cantonal legislation.

[**Art. 20** Land reorganisation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_20) 

Land reorganisation may be officially ordered and carried out if this is required by the land use plans.

### [Section 2 Effects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#tit_2/chap_3/sec_2)

[**Art. 21** Binding character and amendment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_21) 

[1] Land use plans shall be universally binding.

[2] Should circumstances change appreciably, land use plans shall be reviewed and, if necessary, amended.

[**Art. 22** Building permits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_22) 

[1] Buildings and installations may be erected or modified only with the permission of the responsible authority.

[2] The basic requirement for a permit is:


|    a. that the buildings and installations conform to the purpose of the land use zone; and  
|    b. that the land is connected to infrastructure and utilities.

[3] The other requirements contained in federal and cantonal law continue to apply.

[**Art. 23** Exceptions within building zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_23) 

Cantonal legislation regulates exceptions within the building zones.

[**Art. 24**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_24) [Exceptions for buildings and installations outside building zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_24) 

Notwithstanding Article 22 paragraph 2a, permits to erect buildings and installations or to modify their purpose may be granted:


|    a. if the purpose of the buildings and installations necessitates their location outside the building zones; and   
|    b. if there are no overriding interests to the contrary.

[**Art. 24***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_24_a) [Changes in purpose outside building zones for which construction work is not required](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_24_a) 

[1] If the change in purpose of a building or installation outside the building zone does not necessitate any construction work within the meaning of Article 22 paragraph 1, a permit shall be issued if:


|    a. the change of purpose will not have any new impact on space, infrastructure provision and the environment; and  
|    b. it is not prohibited by any other federal enactment.

[2] The exceptional permit must be issued subject to the condition that a new official ruling be made should circumstances change.

[**Art. 24***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_24_b) [Non-agricultural subsidiary operations outside building zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_24_b) 

[1] Should an agricultural business within the meaning of the Federal Act of 4 October 1991 on Rural Land Rights be unable to survive without an additional source of income, a permit may be granted for construction work related to a non-agricultural subsidiary operation which is closely related to the primary concern and located in existing buildings and installations. The requirement set out in Article 24*a* need not be met.

[1bis] Irrespective of whether an additional source of income is required, a permit may be granted for subsidiary operations with a close practical connection to an agricultural business; for this purpose, a permit may be granted for modest expansions where no space or insufficient space is available in the existing buildings and installations.

[1ter] In the case of temporary operating centres, a permit may be granted for construction work only in the existing buildings and installations and only for subsidiary operations offering accommodation and restaurant services.

[1quater] In order to avoid distortions of competition, non-agricultural subsidiary operations must satisfy the same statutory requirements and general conditions as commercial operations in similar situations in the building zone. 

[2] The subsidiary operation may be run only by the manager of the agricultural business or his or her spouse or cohabitee. Employees who work mainly or exclusively for the subsidiary operation may only be employed for subsidiary operations in accordance with paragraph 1[bis]. In every case, the work of this part of the business must be predominantly carried out by the managing family.

[3] The existence of the subsidiary operation must be recorded in the Land Register.

[4] Non-agricultural subsidiary operations constitute integral parts of the agricultural business and are subject to the prohibition of division and fragmentation of property pursuant to Articles 58–60 of the Federal Act of 4 October 1991 on Rural Land Rights. 

[5] The provisions of the Federal Act of 4 October 1991 on Rural Land Rights with respect to non-agricultural businesses do not apply to subsidiary operations.

[**Art. 24***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_24_c) [Existing buildings and installations in breach of zone requirements outside building zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1979/1573_1573_1573/en#art_24_c) 

[1] Buildings and installations outside building zones that may be used in accordance with the law but which no longer conform to zone requirements are in principle protected in their current state.

[2] Such buildings and installations may, with the permission of the competent authority, be renovated, partially modified, moderately expanded or reconstructed, provided they have been lawfully constructed or modified.

[3] The foregoing also applies to farmhouses and attached commercial buildings that have been lawfully constructed or modified before the parcel of land concerned become part of the area where building is not permitted in accordance with federal law. The Federal Council shall issue regulations in order to prevent negative consequences for agriculture.

[4] Changes to external appearance must be necessary to enable modern residential use or to upgrade energy efficiency or so as to blend more harmoniously into the landscape.

[5] Every case is subject to compatibility with the priority concerns of spatial planning.

[1] Authorisation may be given for agricultural residential buildings to be used for non-agricultural residential purposes, provided the essential character of the buildings is preserved.

[1bis] …

[2] A complete change of purpose of buildings and installations that have been recognised as being worthy of preservation may be authorised if:


|    a. these have been given protected status by the competent authority; and  
|    b. their continued preservation cannot otherwise be guaranteed. 

[3] Permits under this Article may be issued only if:


|    a. the building or installation is no longer required for its previous purpose, is suitable for the intended use, and no unnecessary replacement buildings will result;   
|    b. the external appearance and the basic structure of the building remain essentially unchanged;  
|    c. no more than a minor extension of existing infrastructure is necessary and all infrastructure costs incurred as a result of the complete change of purpose of the buildings and installations will be passed on to their owners;  
|    d. the agricultural cultivation of the surrounding land is not endangered;  
|    e. there are no overriding interests to the contrary.

[1] Provided the essential character of the buildings is preserved, construction work shall be permitted in uninhabited buildings or parts of buildings where they are used by residents of an adjacent residential building for the purpose of keeping animals as a hobby and animal welfare standards are respected. 

[2] New outdoor installations may be permitted in terms of paragraph 1 if they are necessary for keeping animals in accordance with animal welfare standards. Such installations may be larger than the statutory minimum size provided this is compatible with the main aspects of spatial planning and the installation is a reversible construction.

[3] The outdoor installations may be used for keeping animals as a hobby provided no structural alterations are required and there is no new impact on the surrounding area and the environment. 

[4] If animals are kept in a building zone, permission shall also be given to fenced-in areas for grazing purposes provided there is no negative impact on the landscape. 

[5] Permits in accordance with this Article may only be given if the requirements of Article 24*d* paragraph 3 are met.

[6] The Federal Council shall regulate the details. In particular it shall define the relationship between the modifications possible under this Article and those under Article 24*c* and Article 24*d* paragraph 1.
