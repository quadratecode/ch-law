|    a. the law;  
|    b. a contract;

[2] A person commits a felony or misdemeanour wilfully if he carries out the act in the knowledge of what he is doing and in accordance with his will. A person acts wilfully as soon as he regards the realisation of the act as being possible and accepts this.

[3] A person commits a felony or misdemeanour through negligence if he fails to consider or disregards the consequences of his conduct due to a culpable lack of care. A lack of care is culpable if the person fails to exercise the care that is incumbent on him in the circumstances and commensurate with his personal capabilities.

##### [1. Monetary penalty](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_1)

###### [Assessment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_1/lvl_d6610e93)

[**Art. 34**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_34) 

[1] Unless the law provides otherwise, a monetary penalty amounts to a minimum of three and a maximum of 180 daily penalty units. The court decides on the number according to the culpability of the offender.

[2] A daily penalty unit normally amounts to a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 3000 francs. By way of exception, if the offender’s personal or financial circumstances so require, the value of the daily penalty unit may be reduced to 10 francs. The court decides on the value of the daily penalty unit according to the personal and financial circumstances of the offender at the time of conviction, and in particular according to his income and capital, living expenses, any maintenance or support obligations and the minimum subsistence level.

[3] The authorities of the Confederation, the cantons and the communes shall provide the information required to determine the daily penalty unit.

[4] The number and value of the daily penalty units must be stated in the judgment.

###### [Execution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_1/lvl_d6610e95)

[**Art. 35**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_35) 

[1] The executive authority shall specify that the offender make payment within a period of between one and six months. It may stipulate payment by instalments and on request may extend the period allowed.

[2] If there is justified suspicion that the offender will fail to pay the monetary penalty, the executive authority may request immediate payment or the provision of security.

[3] If the offender fails to pay the monetary penalty within the specified period, the executive authority shall instruct the debt collection proceedings provided their success is expected.

###### [Alternative custodial sentence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_1/lvl_d6610e97)

[**Art. 36**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_36) 

[1] In the event that the offender fails to pay the monetary penalty and it is not recoverable through debt collection procedures (Art. 35 para. 3), the offender shall serve a custodial sentence as the alternative to the monetary penalty. A daily penalty unit corresponds to one day in custody. The retrospective payment of the monetary penalty leads to a corresponding reduction in the alternative custodial sentence.

[2] If the monetary penalty has been imposed by an administrative authority, the court decides on the alternative custodial sentence.

[**Art. 40**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_40)

[1] The minimum term of a custodial sentence is three days; a shorter custodial sentence in lieu of an unpaid monetary penalty (Art. 36) or fine (Art. 106) is reserved.

[2] The maximum term of a custodial sentence is 20 years. Where the law expressly provides, the custodial sentence is for life

###### [Custodial sentence instead of a monetary penalty](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_3/lvl_d6610e105)

[**Art. 41**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_41)

[1] The court may impose a custodial sentence instead of a monetary penalty if:


|    a. a custodial sentence appears appropriate in order to prevent the offender from committing further felonies or misdemeanours; or  
|    b. it is anticipated that it will not be possible to enforce a monetary penalty.

[2] The court must explain why it has decided to impose a custodial sentence.

[3] The right is reserved to impose a custodial sentence instead of an unpaid monetary penalty (Art. 36).

[**Art. 42**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_42) 

[1] The court shall normally suspend the execution of a monetary penalty or a custodial sentence of no more than two years unless an unsuspended sentence appears to be necessary in order to prevent the offender from committing further felonies or misdemeanours.

[2] If the offender received a suspended or unsuspended custodial sentence of more than six months within the five years prior to the offence, the sentence may only be suspended where the circumstances are especially favourable.

[3] The suspension of the execution of a sentence may also be refused if the offender has failed to make a reasonable effort to compensate for any loss or damage he may have caused.

[4] A suspended sentence may be combined with a fine in accordance with Article 106.

##### [2. Partially suspended custodial sentences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_2)

[**Art. 43**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_43) 

[1] The court may partially suspend the execution of a custodial sentence of at least one year and no more than three years if this is necessary in order to take sufficient account of the culpability of the offender.

[2] The part of the sentence that must be executed immediately may not exceed one half of the sentence.

[3] Both the suspended and the unsuspended part must amount to at least six months. The provisions on the granting of parole (Art. 86) do not apply to the unsuspended part of the sentence.

[**Art. 44**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_44) 

[1] If the court suspends the execution of a sentence in full or in part, it shall make the offender subject to a probationary period of from two to five years.

[2] The court may order probation assistance and impose conduct orders for the duration of the probationary period.

[3] The court shall explain the importance and the consequences of the suspended and partially suspended sentence to the offender.

###### [Successful completion of probation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_3/lvl_d6610e116)

[**Art. 45**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_45) 

If the offender is of good conduct until the expiry of the probationary period, the postponed sentence is not executed.

###### [Breach of probation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_3/lvl_d6610e118)

[**Art. 46**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_46) 

[1] If the offender commits a felony or misdemeanour during the probationary period and if it therefore must be expected that he will commit further offences, the court shall revoke the suspended sentence or the suspended part of the sentence. If the revoked sentence and the new sentence are of the same type, they shall form a cumulative sentence in analogous application of Article 49.

[2] If it is not expected that the offender will commit further offences, the court shall not revoke the suspended sentence. It may admonish the offender or extend the probationary period by up to one half of the duration specified in the judgment. The court may order probation assistance and impose conduct orders for the duration of the extended probationary period. If the extension begins after the expiry of the probationary period, the extended period begins on the day that it is ordered.

[3] The court that judges the new felony or misdemeanour also decides on revocation.

[4] If the offender fails to attend for probation assistance or disregards the conduct orders, Article 95 paragraphs 3–5 apply.

[5] Revocation may no longer be ordered if three years have elapsed since the expiry of the probationary period.

#### [Section Three: Determination of the Sentence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_3)

[**Art. 47**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_47) 

[1] The court determines the sentence according to the culpability of the offender. It takes account of the previous conduct and the personal circumstances of the offender as well as the effect that the sentence will have on his life.

[2] Culpability is assessed according to the seriousness of the damage or danger to the legal interest concerned, the reprehensibility of the conduct, the offender's motives and aims, and the extent to which the offender, in view of the personal and external circumstances, could have avoided causing the danger or damage.

##### [2. Mitigation of the sentence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_3/lvl_2)

[**Art. 48**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_48) 

The court shall reduce the sentence if:


|    a. the offender acted:  
|    1. for honourable motives,  
|    2. while in serious distress,  
|    3. while of the view that he was under serious threat,  
|    4. at the behest of a person whom he was duty bound to obey or on whom he was dependent;


|    b. the offender was seriously provoked by the conduct of the person suffering injury;  
|    c. the offender acted in a state of extreme emotion that was excusable in the circumstances or while under serious psychological stress;  
|    d. the offender has shown genuine remorse, and in particular has made reparation for the injury, damage or loss caused, insofar as this may reasonably be expected of him;  
|    e. the need for punishment has been substantially reduced due to the time that has elapsed since the offence and the offender has been of good conduct in this period.

###### [Effect](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_3/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e127)

[**Art. 48***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_48_a) 

[1] If the court chooses to reduce the sentence, it is not bound by the minimum penalty that the offence carries.

[2] The court may impose a different form of penalty from that which the offence carries, but remains bound by the statutory maximum and minimum levels for that form of penalty.

##### [3. Concurrent sentencing](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_3/lvl_3)

[**Art. 49**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_49) 

[1] If the offender, by committing one or more offences, has fulfilled the requirements for two or more penalties of the same form, the court shall impose the sentence for the most serious offence at an appropriately increased level. It may not, however, increase the maximum level of the sentence by more than half, and it is bound by the statutory maximum for that form of penalty.

[2] If the court must pass sentence on an offence that the offender committed before he was sentenced for a different offence, it shall determine the supplementary penalty so that the offender is not more severely punished than he would have been had the sentences been imposed at the same time.

[3] If the offender committed one or more offences before reaching the age of 18, the court shall determine the cumulative sentence in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 such that it is not more severe than it would have been had sentences been imposed separately.

##### [4. Obligation to justify](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_3/lvl_4)

[**Art. 50**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_50) 

Where a judgment must be justified, the court shall also specify the circumstances taken into account in determining the sentence and their weighting.

##### [5. Taking account of time spend on remand](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_3/lvl_5)

[**Art. 51**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_51) 

When determining the sentence, the court shall take account of any time spent on remand that the offender has served in respect of the proceedings in question or any other proceedings. One day in detention corresponds to one daily penalty unit of a monetary penalty.

#### [Section Four: Exemption from Punishment and the Suspension and Abandonment of Proceedings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_4)

[**Art. 53**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_53)

If the offender has made reparation for the loss, damage or injury or made every reasonable effort to right the wrong that he has caused, the competent authority shall refrain from prosecuting him, bringing him to court or punishing him if:


|    a. a suspended custodial sentence not exceeding one year, a suspended monetary penalty or a fine are suitable as a penalty;  
|    b. the interest in prosecution of the general public and of the persons harmed are negligible; and  
|    c. the offender has admitted the offence.

###### [Effect on the offender of his act](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_4/lvl_1/lvl_d6610e142)

[**Art. 54**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_54) 

If the offender is so seriously affected by the immediate consequences of his act that a penalty would be inappropriate, the responsible authorities shall refrain from prosecuting him, bringing him to court or punishing him.

|    a. the victim:  
|    1. is the spouse of the offender and the offence was committed during the marriage or within a year of divorce, or  
|    2. is the registered partner of the offender and the offence was committed during the registered partnership or within a year of its dissolution, or  
|    3. is the hetero- or homosexual partner of the offender or the ex-partner of the offender if they have been separated for less than a year; and


|    b. the victim or, if he or she lacks legal capacity, his or her legal representative requests this to be done; and  
|    c. suspension appears appropriate in order to stabilise or improve the victim’s situation.

[2] The public prosecutor or the court may during the period of suspension require the accused to attend a course on violence prevention. The public prosecutor or the court shall notify the authority or organisation competent under cantonal law for matters relating to domestic violence about the measures taken.

[3] Suspension is not permitted if:


|    a. the accused has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanour against life and limb, against liberty, or against sexual integrity;  
|    b. he or she has received a sentence or been made subject to a measure; and  
|    c. the victim of the offence is a person listed in paragraph 1 letter a.

[**Art. 56**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_56) 

[1] A measure is ordered if:


|    a. a penalty alone is not sufficient to counter the risk of further offending by the offender;  
|    b. the offender requires treatment or treatment is required in the interest of public safety; and  
|    c. the requirements of Articles 59–61, 63 or 64 are fulfilled.

[2] The ordering of a measure requires that the related intervention in the personal rights of the offender is not unreasonable in view of the probability and seriousness of additional offences.

[3] In ordering a measure under Articles 59–61, 63 and 64 and in modifying the sanction in accordance with Article 65, the court shall base its decision on an expert assessment. This shall provide an opinion on:


|    a. the necessity and the prospects of success of any treatment of the offender;  
|    b. the nature and the probability of possible additional offences; and  
|    c. the ways in which the measure may be implemented.

[4] If the offender has committed an offence in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1, the assessment must be conducted by an expert who has neither treated the offender before nor been responsible in any other way for his care.

[4bis] If consideration is given to ordering lifelong incarceration in accordance with Article 64 paragraph 1[bis], the court shall base its decision on reports from at least two experienced specialists who are independent of each other and who have neither treated the offender nor been responsible in any other way for his care.

[5] Normally the court only orders a measure if a suitable institution is available.

[6] Where the requirements for a measure are no longer fulfilled, it is revoked.

[**Art. 56***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_56_a) 

[1] If two or more measures are equally suitable but only one is necessary, the court shall order the measure that is more convenient for the offender.

[2] If two or more measures are necessary, the court may order these concurrently.

###### [Relationship between measures and penalties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_1/lvl_d6610e156)

[**Art. 57**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_57) 

[1] If the requirements for both a penalty and a measure are fulfilled, the court shall order both sanctions.

[2] The implementation of a measure under Articles 59–61 takes precedence over a custodial sentence that is imposed at the same time or which is executed through revocation of a suspended sentence or recall to custody. Likewise, the reactivation of the execution of a measure in accordance with Article 62*a* takes precedence over a cumulative sentence imposed at the same time.

[3] The deprivation of liberty associated with the measure must be taken into account in determining the penalty.

###### [Implementation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_1/lvl_d6610e159)

[1] ...

[2] The therapeutic institutions in terms of Articles 59–61 must be managed separately from penal institutions.

##### [2. In-patient therapeutic measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_2)

###### [Treatment of mental disorders](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e162)

[**Art. 59**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_59) 

[1] If the offender is suffering from a serious mental disorder, the court may order in-patient treatment if:


|    a. the offender's mental disorder was a factor in a felony or misdemeanour that he committed; and  
|    b. it is expected that the measure will reduce the risk of further offences being committed in which his mental disorder is a factor.

[2] The in-patient treatment is carried out in an appropriate psychiatric institution or therapeutic institution.

[3] If there is a risk of the offender absconding or committing further offences, he shall be treated in a secure institution. He may also be treated in a penal institution in accordance with Article 76 paragraph 2, provided it is guaranteed that the required therapeutic treatment can be provided by specialist staff.

[4] The deprivation of liberty associated with in-patient treatment normally amounts to a maximum of five years. If the requirements for parole have not yet been fulfilled after five years and if it is expected that the measure will reduce the risk of further felonies or misdemeanours being committed in which his mental disorder is a factor, the court may at the request of the executive authority order the extension of the measure for a maximum of five years in any case.

###### [Treatment of addiction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e164)

[**Art. 60**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_60) 

[1] If the offender is dependent on addictive substances or in any other way dependent, the court may order in-patient treatment if:


|    a. the offender's dependence was a factor in the felony or misdemeanour that he committed; and  
|    b. it is expected that treatment will reduce the risk of further offences being committed in which his dependence is a factor.

[2] The court shall take account of the offender's request for and readiness to undergo treatment.

[3] The treatment is carried out in a specialised institution or, if necessary, in a psychiatric hospital. It must be adjusted to the special needs of the offender and the state of his health.

[4] The deprivation of liberty associated with in-patient treatment shall normally amount to a maximum of three years. If the requirements for parole have not yet been fulfilled after three years and if it is expected that the measure will reduce the risk of further felonies or misdemeanours being committed in which his dependence is a factor, the court may at the request of the executive authority on one occasion only order the extension of the measure for a maximum of one further year. In the event of an extension and the recall to custody following parole, the deprivation of liberty associated with the measure may not exceed a maximum of six years.

###### [Measures for young adults](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e166)

[**Art. 61**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_61) 

[1] If the offender was under 25 years of age at the time of the offence and if he is suffering from a serious developmental disorder, the court may commit him to an institution for young adults if:


|    a. the offender's developmental disorder was a factor in the felony or misdemeanour that he committed; and  
|    b. it is expected that the measure will reduce the risk of further offences being committed in which his developmental disorder is a factor.

[2] Institutions for young adults must be managed separately from other institutions and facilities under this Code.

[3] The offender should be taught the skills needed to live independently and without further offending. In particular, he should be encouraged to undergo basic and advanced vocational and professional training.

[4] The deprivation of liberty associated with the measure amounts to a maximum of four years. In the event of the recall to custody following release on parole, it may not exceed a maximum of six years. The measure must be revoked when the offender reaches the age of 30.

[5] If the offender was convicted of an offence committed before he was 18 years of age, the measure may be implemented in an institution for minors.

###### [Parole](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e168)

[**Art. 62**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_62) 

[1] The offender is released on parole from undergoing an in-patient measure as soon as his condition justifies his being given the liberty to prove himself.

[2] In the case of release on parole from a measure under Article 59, the probationary period amounts to one to five years, and in the case of release on parole from a measure under Articles 60 and 61, from one to three years.

[3] The person released on parole may be required to undergo out-patient treatment during the probationary period. The executive authority may order probation assistance and issue conduct orders for the duration the probationary period.

[4] If on expiry of the probationary period, a continuation of the out-patient treatment, the probation assistance or the conduct orders is considered necessary in order to reduce the risk of further felonies and misdemeanours being committed that are associated with the condition of the person released on parole, the court may at the request of the executive authority extend the probationary period as follows:


|    a. by one to five years in the case of release on parole from a measure in accordance with Article 59;  
|    b. by one to three years in the case of release on parole from a measure under Articles 60 and 61.

[5] The probationary period following release on parole from a measure under Articles 60 and 61 may not exceed six years.

[6] If the offender has committed an offence in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1, the probationary period may be extended as often as is considered necessary to prevent further such offences being committed.

###### [Breach of probation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e171)

[**Art. 62***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_62_a) 

[1] If a person released on parole commits an offence during the probationary period and thus demonstrates that the risk that the measure was intended to reduce is still present, the court assessing the new offence may, after consulting the executive authority:


|    a. order his recall to custody;  
|    b. revoke the measure and, provided the relevant requirements are fulfilled, order a new measure; or  
|    c. revoke the measure and, provided the relevant requirements are fulfilled, order the execution of a custodial sentence.

[2] If as a result of the new offence the requirements for an unsuspended custodial sentence are fulfilled and if this sentence runs concurrently with a custodial sentence that has been suspended to give precedence to the measure, the court shall impose a cumulative sentence in application of Article 49.

[3] If as a result of the conduct of the person released on parole during the probationary period there is a serious expectation that he could commit an offence in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1, the court that ordered the measure may, at the request of the executive authority, order a recall to custody.

[4] For a measure under Article 59, the recall to custody is for a maximum period of five years, and for measures under Articles 60 and 61 for a maximum period of two years.

[5] If the court decides against a recall to custody or a new measure, it may:


|    a. admonish the person released on parole;  
|    b. order out-patient treatment or probation assistance;  
|    c. impose conduct orders on the person released on parole; and  
|    d. extend the probationary period by from one to five years in the case of a measure under Article 59, and by from one to three years in the case of a measure under Articles 60 and 61.

[6] If the person released on parole fails to comply with the terms of probation assistance or disregards the conduct orders, Article 95 paragraphs 3–5 applies.

###### [Final release](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e173)

[**Art. 62***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_62_b) 

[1] If the person released on parole successfully completes the probationary period, he is granted final release.

[2] The offender is granted final release if the maximum duration of a measure under Articles 60 and 61 is reached and the requirements for the parole apply.

[3] If deprivation of liberty associated with the measure is for a shorter period than the suspended custodial sentence, the remainder of the sentence is not executed.

###### [Termination of a measure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e175)

[**Art. 62***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_62_c) 

[1] A measure is terminated, if:


|    a. its implementation or continuation appears to have no prospect of success;   
|    b. the maximum duration under Articles 60 and 61 has been reached and the requirements for the parole do not apply; or  
|    c. a suitable institution does not exist or no longer exists.

[2] If the deprivation of liberty associated with the measure is for a shorter period than the suspended custodial sentence, the remainder of the sentence is executed. If the requirements for parole or a suspended custodial sentence apply in relation to the remainder of the sentence, execution of the sentence is suspended.

[3] Instead of ordering the execution of the sentence, the court may order another measure if it is to be expected that such a measure will reduce the risk of the offender committing further felonies and misdemeanours in which his condition is a factor.

[4] If there is a serious expectation that if a measure ordered in respect of an offence in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1 is terminated, the offender will commit further such offences, the court may at the request of the executive authority order his indefinite incarceration.

[5] If the competent authority regards an adult protection measure to be appropriate on the termination of the measure, it shall inform the adult protection authority of this.

[6] Furthermore, the court may terminate an in-patient therapeutic measure before or during its implementation and order another in-patient therapeutic measure in its place if it is expected that the new measure has a significantly better chance of reducing the risk of the offender committing further felonies and misdemeanours in which his condition is a factor.

###### [Consideration of release and the termination of measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e177)

[**Art. 62***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_62_d) 

[1] The competent authority shall on request or ex officio consider whether and when the offender should be released on parole from the implementation of the measure or whether the measure should be terminated. It makes a decision on such matters at least once each year. It shall first grant a hearing to the offender and obtain a report from the governing body of the relevant institution.

[2] If the offender committed an offence in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1, the competent authority shall reach its decision on the basis of the expert opinion of an independent specialist and after hearing a committee comprising representatives of the prosecution services, the execution authorities and one or more psychiatrists. The specialists and psychiatrists concerned must not be those responsible for the treatment or care of the offender.

##### [3. Out-patient treatment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_3)

###### [Requirements and implementation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_3/lvl_d6610e180)

[**Art. 63**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_63) 

[1] If the offender is suffering from a serious mental disorder or if he is dependent on addictive substances or in any other way, the court may order that he receive out-patient rather than in-patient treatment if:


|    a. the offender commits an offence in which his condition is a factor; and  
|    b. it is expected that the measure will reduce the risk of further offences being committed in which his condition is a factor.

[2] The court may defer the execution of an unsuspended custodial sentence imposed at the same time, a suspended custodial sentence due for execution following revocation of suspension and the remainder of a sentence due for execution following a recall to custody to give precedence to out-patient treatment in order to take account of the form of the treatment. It may order probation assistance and issue conduct orders for the duration the treatment.

[3] The competent authority may order the offender to be treated temporarily as an in-patient if this is required in order to initiate the out-patient treatment. The period of in-patient treatment may not exceed two months.

[4] The period of out-patient treatment may not normally exceed five years. If the continuation of the out-patient treatment is considered necessary at the end of the five-year period in order to reduce the risk of further felonies and misdemeanours in which a mental disorder is a factor, the court may at the request of the executive authority continue the treatment for a further period of from one to five years.

###### [Termination of the measure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_3/lvl_d6610e183)

[**Art. 63***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_63_a) 

[1] The competent authority shall assess at least once each year whether the out-patient treatment should be continued or terminated. It shall first grant a hearing to the offender and obtain a report from the therapists.

[2] The out-patient treatment is terminated by the competent authority if:


|    a. it has been successfully completed;  
|    b. its continuation appears to have no prospect of success; or  
|    c. the statutory maximum duration for the treatment of an alcohol, drug or therapeutic product dependent person has been reached.

[3] If the offender commits a further offence during the out-patient treatment and thus demonstrates that this form of treatment will probably be unsuccessful in averting the risk offences being committed in which the condition of the offender is a factor, the unsuccessful treatment shall be terminated by order of the court assessing the new offence.

[4] If the offender fails to comply with the conditions of probation assistance or if he disregards the conduct orders, Article 95 paragraphs 3–5 applies.

###### [Execution of the suspended custodial sentence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_3/lvl_d6610e185)

[**Art. 63***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_63_b) 

[1] If the out-patient treatment has been successfully completed, the suspended custodial sentence is not executed.

[2] If out-patient treatment is terminated due to there being no prospect of success (Art. 63*a* para. 2 let. b), the statutory maximum duration being reached (Art. 63*a* para. 2 let. c) or its being unsuccessful (Art. 63*a* para. 3), the suspended custodial sentence is executed.

[3] If out-patient treatment conducted while the offender is at liberty is considered a risk to third parties, the suspended custodial sentence is executed and the out-patient treatment continued while the custodial sentence is being served.

[4] The court decides on the extent to which the deprivation of liberty associated with the out-patient treatment is taken into account in determining the custodial sentence. If the requirements for parole or a suspended custodial sentence apply in relation to the remainder of the sentence, execution of the sentence is suspended.

[5] Instead of the execution of the sentence the court may order an in-patient therapeutic measure under Articles 59–61 if it is to be expected that this will reduce the risk of the offender committing further felonies or misdemeanours in which his condition is a factor.

##### [4. Indefinite incarceration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_4)

###### [Requirements and execution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_4/lvl_d6610e188)

[**Art. 64**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_64) 

[1] The court shall order indefinite incarceration if the offender has committed murder, intentional homicide, serious assault, rape, robbery, hostage taking, arson, endangering life or another offence that carries a maximum sentence of five or more years by which he has caused or intended to cause serious detriment to the physical, psychological or sexual integrity of another person, and if:


|    a. due to the personality traits of the offender, the circumstances of the offence and his general personal circumstances, it is seriously expected that he will commit further offences of the same type; or  
|    b. due to a permanent or long-term mental disorder of considerable gravity that was a factor in the offence, it is seriously expected that the offender will commit further offences of the same type and the ordering of a measure in accordance with Article 59 does not promise any success.

[1bis] The court shall order lifelong incarceration if the offender has committed murder, intentional homicide, serious assault, robbery, rape, indecent assault, false imprisonment or abduction, hostage-taking, enforced disappearance of persons, trafficking in human beings, genocide, or a felony under the heading of crimes against humanity or war crimes (Title Twelve) and if the following requirements are met:

a. the offender, by committing the offence, caused or intended to cause serious detriment to the physical, psychological or sexual integrity of another person.


|    b. There is a high probability that the offender will commit one of these felonies again.  
|    c. The offender is assessed as being permanently untreatable, as the treatment offers no long-term prospect of success.

[2] The execution of the custodial sentence takes priority over indefinite incarceration. The provisions on parole in relation to the custodial sentence (Art. 86–88) do not apply.

[3] If during the execution of the custodial sentence, it is expected that the offender will prove to be of good behaviour when at liberty, the court shall order parole from the custodial sentence at the earliest from the time when the offender has served two thirds of a specific custodial sentence or 15 years of a life sentence. The court that ordered indefinite incarceration is responsible for the decision on parole. In addition, Article 64*a* applies.

[4] Indefinite incarceration is executed in a therapeutic institution or in a penal institution in accordance with Article 76 paragraph 2. Public safety must be guaranteed. The offender receives psychiatric care if this is necessary.

###### [Revocation and release](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_4/lvl_d6610e190)

[**Art. 64***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_64_a) 

[1] The offender is released on parole from indefinite incarceration in accordance with Article 64 paragraph 1 as soon as it is expected that he will be of good behaviour when at liberty. The probationary period amounts to two to five years. For the duration of the probationary period, probation assistance may be ordered and conduct orders may be imposed.

[2] If on expiry of the probationary period a continuation of the probation assistance or the conduct orders is considered to be necessary in order to reduce the risk of further offences in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1, the court may at the request of the executive authority extend the probationary period by a further two to five years.

[3] If due to his conduct during the probationary period, it is seriously expected that the offender may commit further offences in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1, the court at the request of the executive authority shall order his recall to custody.

[4] If the offender when released on parole fails to comply with the conditions of probation assistance or disregards the conduct orders, Article 95 paragraphs 3–5 applies.

[5] If the offender when released on parole is of good behaviour until the expiry of the probationary period, he is granted final release.

###### [Consideration of release](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_4/lvl_d6610e192)

[**Art. 64***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_64_b)

[1] The competent authority shall consider on request or ex officio:


|    a. at least once annually, and for the first time after two years have lapsed, whether and when the offender may be released on parole from indefinite incarceration (Art. 64*a* para. 1);   
|    b. at least every two years, and for the first time before indefinite incarceration takes effect, whether the requirements for an in-patient therapeutic treatment have been fulfilled and whether a related application should therefore be made to the competent court (Art. 65 para. 1).

[2] The competent authority makes its decisions in terms of paragraph 1 based on: 


|    a. a report from the institution board;   
|    b. an independent specialist assessment in terms of Article 56 paragraph 4;  
|    c. its hearing of a committee in accordance with Article 62*d* paragraph 2;  
|    d. its hearing of the offender.

###### [Consideration of release from lifelong incarceration and parole](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_4/lvl_d6610e195)

[**Art. 64***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_64_c)

[1] In cases of lifelong incarceration under Article 64 paragraph 1[bis] the competent authority shall consider ex officio or on application whether there are any new scientific findings that lead to the expectation that the offender can be treated so that he will no longer pose a risk to the public. It decides on the basis of a report from the Federal Commission for the Assessment of the Treatability of Offenders subject to Lifelong Incarceration.

[2] If the competent authority concludes that the offender can be treated, it shall offer him the option of treatment. Treatment is carried out in a secure institution. Until the order imposing lifelong incarceration has been revoked in accordance with paragraph 3, the provisions on the execution of lifelong incarceration continue to apply.

[3] If the treatment demonstrates that the risk posed by the offender has been considerably reduced and may be reduced to the extent that he no longer poses a risk to the public, the court shall revoke the order imposing lifelong incarceration and order an in-patient therapeutic measure in accordance with Articles 59–61 in a secure institution.

[4] The court may grant the offender parole from lifelong incarceration if he no longer poses a risk to the public due to old age, serious illness or on other grounds. Parole is governed by Article 64*a*.

[5] The court that ordered lifelong incarceration is responsible for deciding whether parole should be granted. It bases its decision on reports from at least two experienced specialists who are independent of each other and who have neither treated the offender nor been responsible in any other way for his care.

[6] Paragraphs 1 and 2 also apply during the execution of the custodial sentence that precedes lifelong incarceration. Lifelong incarceration shall be revoked in accordance with paragraph 3 at the earliest when the offender has served two thirds of a specific custodial sentence or 15 years of a life sentence.

##### [5. Modification of the sanction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_1/lvl_5)

[**Art. 65**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_65) 

[1] If an offender fulfils the requirements for an in-patient therapeutic measure in terms of Articles 59–61 before or during the execution of a custodial sentence or of indefinite incarceration in accordance with Article 64 paragraph 1, the court may order this measure retrospectively. The competent court is the court that imposed the sentence or ordered indefinite incarceration. The execution of any remainder of the sentence is deferred.

[2] If during the execution of the custodial sentence, new information or evidence comes to light to the effect that the requirements for indefinite incarceration are fulfilled and already applied at the time of conviction although the court could not have had knowledge of this, the court may order indefinite incarceration retrospectively. Jurisdiction and procedure are determined by the rules that apply to re-opening a case.

#### [Section Two: Other Measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2)

##### [1. Good behaviour bond](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_1)

[**Art. 66**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_66) 

[1] If there is the risk that a person will commit a felony or misdemeanour that he has threatened to commit, or if a person convicted of a felony or of a misdemeanour indicates the clear intention to repeat the offence, the court may, at the request of the person threatened, obtain a promise from the offender that he will not commit the offence and require him to deposit appropriate security therefor.

[2] If he refuses to make the promise, or fails to deposit the security within the specified period, the court may require him to make the promise or deposit the security by imposing a period of detention for security reasons. The period of detention for security reasons may not be for more than two months. It is executed in the same way as a short custodial sentence (Art. 79).

[3] If the offender commits the felony or the misdemeanour within two years of depositing the security, the security is forfeited to the State. If no offence is committed, the security is returned.

##### [1*a*. Expulsion.](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_1_a)

[2] The court may by way of exception refrain from ordering expulsion if it would cause serious personal hardship to the foreign national concerned and the public interest in expulsion does not outweigh the private interest of the foreign national in remaining in Switzerland. In such cases, account must be taken of the special position of foreign nationals who were born or have grown up in Switzerland.

[3] The court may also refrain from ordering expulsion if the offence was committed in justifiable self-defence (Art. 16 para. 1) or in a justifiable situation of necessity (Art. 18 para. 1).

[**Art. 66***a*[bis]](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_66_a_bis)

The court may expel a foreign national from Switzerland for 3–15 years if he is convicted and sentenced or made subject to a measure under Articles 59–61 or 64 for a felony or misdemeanour that is not listed in Article 66*a*.

###### [c. Common provisions. Repeat offence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_1_a/lvl_c)

[**Art. 66***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_66_b)

[1] Any person who has been made subject to an expulsion order who commits a further offence that meets the requirements for expulsion under Article 66*a* shall be expelled again for 20 years.

[2] Lifelong expulsion may be ordered if the offender commits the new offence while the previous expulsion order is still in effect.

###### [d. Time of enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_1_a/lvl_d)

[**Art. 66***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_66_c)

[1] The expulsion order applies from the date on which the judgment becomes legally enforceable.

[2] Before enforcing the expulsion order, any unsuspended sentences or parts thereof and any custodial measures must be executed.

[3] The expulsion order is enforced as soon as the offender is conditionally or finally released from the execution of criminal penalties or measures or the custodial measure is revoked, provided that the remainder of sentence need not be executed and no other such measure has been ordered.

[4] If a person subject to an expulsion order is transferred to his home country for the execution of criminal penalties or measures, the expulsion order applies on such transfer.

[5] The duration of expulsion is calculated from the day on which the offender leaves Switzerland.

[1] The enforcement of a mandatory expulsion order under Article 66*a* may only be deferred if:


|    a. the person concerned is recognised by Switzerland as a refugee and, if expelled, his life or his freedom would be endangered due to his race, religion, nationality, affiliation to a specific social group or his political views; the foregoing does not apply to a refugee who may not invoke the ban on refoulement under Article 5 paragraph 2 of the Asylum Act of 26 June 1998;  
|    b. expulsion would violate other mandatory provisions of international law.

[2] In reaching its decision, the competent cantonal authority must assume that expulsion to a state deemed safe by the Federal Council in accordance with Article 6*a* paragraph 2 of the Asylum Act of 26 June 1998 does not violate Article 25 paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Federal Constitution.

[**Art. 67**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_67)

[1] If a person has committed a felony or misdemeanour while carrying on a professional activity or an organised non-professional activity, and has as a result received a custodial sentence in excess of six months, and if there is a risk that he will abuse his activity in order to commit a further felony or misdemeanour, the court may prohibit him totally or partially from carrying on this activity or comparable activities for a period of six months to five years.

[2] If a person has committed a felony or misdemeanour against a minor or another especially vulnerable person and if there is a risk that in carrying on a professional activity or an organised non-professional activity that involves regular contact with any minors or with other especially vulnerable persons he will commit further offences of this nature, the court may prohibit him from carrying on the activity concerned for one to ten years.

[2bis] The court may impose a lifelong prohibition order under paragraph 2 if is anticipated that the offender will still represent a danger after the period of ten years.At the request of the executive authority, it may extend a prohibition order that is limited in time in terms of paragraph 2 by a maximum of five years on any one occasion if this is deemed necessary to prevent the offender from committing further felonies and misdemeanours of the type that led to the prohibition order. 

[3] If a person receives a sentence or is made subject to a measure under Articles 59–61, 63 or 64 for any of the following offences, the court shall prohibit him for the rest of his life from carrying on any professional activity or organised non-professional activity that involves regular contact with any minors:

|    d. pornography (Art. 197):  
|    1. under Article 197 paragraph 1 or 3,  
|    2. under Article 197 paragraph 4 or 5, where the content of the items or performances involved sexual acts with minors. 



[4] If a person receives a sentence or is made subject to a measure under Articles 59–61, 63 or 64 for any of the following offences, the court shall prohibit him from carrying on any professional activity or organised non-professional activity that involves regular contact with especially vulnerable adult persons, as well as any professional activity or organised non-professional activity in the health sector that involves direct contact with patients: 


|    a. trafficking in human beings (Art. 182) for the purpose of sexual exploitation, indecent assault (Art. 189), rape (Art. 190), sexual acts with persons incapable of judgement or resistance (Art. 191), sexual acts with persons in institutional care, prisoners and persons on remand (Art. 192), exploitation of a person in a position of need or dependency (Art. 193), indecent conduct (Art. 194), encouraging prostitution (Art. 195) or sexual harassment (Art. 198), where the offence is committed against or in front of:

|    b. pornography (Art. 197 para. 2 first sentence and para. 4 or 5), where the items or performances had the following content:  
|    1. sexual acts with especially vulnerable adult victims, or   
|    2. sexual acts with adult victims who are not especially vulnerable, but who were incapable of resistance or of judgement or who were unable to defend themselves as a result of physical or psychological dependence.



[4bis] By way of exception, the court may refrain from imposing a prohibition order under paragraph 3 or 4 in particularly minor cases if a prohibition order of this type does not appear necessary to prevent the offender from committing further offences of the same type. The court may not refrain from imposing a prohibition order if the offender:


|    a. has been convicted of trafficking in human beings (Art. 182), indecent assault (Art. 189), rape (Art. 190), sexual acts with persons incapable of judgement or resistance (Art. 191) or encouraging prostitution (Art. 195); or   
|    b. is a paedophile in accordance with the internationally recognised classification criteria. 

[5] If the offender receives a sentence or is made subject to a measure for two or more offences in the same proceedings, the court shall specify what portion of the sentence or which measure applies to an offence that entails an activity prohibition order. This portion of the sentence, the measure and the offence are decisive in determining whether an activity prohibition order under paragraph 1, 2, 2[bis], 3 or 4 is imposed. The sentence portions for two or more relevant offences are added together. More than one activity prohibition order may be imposed.

[6] The court may order probation assistance for the duration of the prohibition orders.

[1] If a person has committed a felony or misdemeanour against one or more specific persons or against persons in a specific group, and if there is a risk that he will commit further felonies or misdemeanours in the event of having contact with such persons, the court may impose a contact prohibition and exclusion order of up to five years.

[2] By means of a contact prohibition and exclusion order the court may prohibit the offender from:


|    a. contacting one or more specific persons or persons in a specific group directly or via third parties, in particular by telephone, in writing or online, or employing, accommodating, educating, caring for such persons or associating with such persons in any other way;  
|    b. approaching a specific person or coming within a specific distance of that person’s home;  
|    c. being present in specific locations, in particular specific streets, areas or districts.

[4] The court may order probation assistance for the duration of the prohibition order.

[5] On application from the executive authority, it may extend limited prohibition orders by a maximum of five years in each case if this is necessary to prevent the offender from committing further felonies and misdemeanours against minors or other especially vulnerable persons.

[1] A prohibition order comes into effect on the day on which the judgment takes full legal effect.

[2] The duration of a custodial sentence or of a custodial measure (Art. 59–61 and 64) is not taken into account in determining the term of the prohibition order.

[3] If the offender fails to complete the probationary period successfully and if the suspended custodial sentence is executed or a recall to custody is ordered in respect of a sentence or measure, the term of the prohibition order is calculated from the day on which the offender is released on parole or granted final release or on which the sanction is revoked or remitted.

[4] If the offender completes the probationary period successfully, the competent authority shall decide on any modification of the conditions or term of the prohibition order under Article 67 paragraph 1 or Article 67*b*, or on whether the prohibition order should be revoked.

[5] The offender may apply to the competent authority for a modification of the conditions or term of the prohibition order, or to have the prohibition order revoked:


|    a. in the case of a prohibition order under Article 67 paragraph 1 or under Article 67*b*: after the order has been in force for two years;

[6bis] Prohibition orders under Article 67 paragraphs 3 or 4 may not revoked. 

[7] If the offender breaches an activity prohibition order or a contact prohibition and exclusion order or if he fails to comply with the associated probation assistance, or if such assistance cannot be provided or is no longer required, the competent authority shall submit a report to the court or the executive authority. The court or the executive authority may revoke or make a new order for probation assistance.

[7bis] The executive authority may order probation assistance for the entire duration of the prohibition from carrying on an activity or the contact and exclusion order.

[8] If the offender fails to comply with the probation assistance during a probationary period, Article 95 paragraphs 4 and 5 apply.

[1] If it becomes apparent during the term of an activity prohibition order or a contact prohibition and exclusion order that in the offender’s case an extension of the prohibition order or an additional such prohibition order is required, the court may on application from the executive authority extend the prohibition order or impose an additional prohibition order.

[2] If it becomes apparent during a custodial sentence or a custodial measure that in the offender’s case a prohibition order under Article 67 paragraph 1 or 2 or under Article 67*b* is required, the court may impose this prohibition order on application from the executive authority.

##### [3. Disqualification from driving](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_3)

[1] The court shall, irrespective of the criminal liability of any person, order the forfeiture of objects that have been used or were intended to be used for the commission of an offence or that have been produced as a result of the commission of an offence in the event that such objects constitute a future danger to public safety, morals or public order.

[2] The court may order that the objects forfeited be rendered unusable or be destroyed.

###### [b. Forfeiture of assets](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_5/lvl_b)

[**Art. 70**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_70) 

[1] The court shall order the forfeiture of assets that have been acquired through the commission of an offence or that are intended to be used in the commission of an offence or as payment therefor, unless the assets are passed on to the person harmed for the purpose of restoring the prior lawful position.

[2] Forfeiture is not permitted if a third party has acquired the assets in ignorance of the grounds for forfeiture, provided he has paid a consideration of equal value therefor or forfeiture would cause him to endure disproportionate hardship.

[3] The right to order forfeiture is limited to seven years; if, however, the prosecution of the offence is subject to a longer limitation period, this period also applies to the right to order forfeiture.

[4] Official notice must be given of forfeiture. The rights of persons harmed or third parties expire five years after the date on which official notice is given.

[5] If the amount of the assets to be forfeited cannot be ascertained, or may be ascertained only by incurring a disproportionate level of trouble and expense, the court may make an estimate.

###### [Equivalent claim](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_5/lvl_b/lvl_d6610e239)

[**Art. 71**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_71) 

[1] If the assets subject to forfeiture are no longer available, the court may uphold a claim for compensation by the State in respect of a sum of equivalent value, which claim may be enforced against a third party only if he is not excluded by Article 70 paragraph 2.

[2] The court may dismiss an equivalent claim in its entirety or in part if the claim is likely to be unrecoverable or if the claim would seriously hinder the rehabilitation of the person concerned.

[3] The investigating authority may seize assets of the person concerned with a view to the enforcement of an equivalent claim. Such seizure does not accord the State preferential rights in the enforcement of the equivalent claim.

###### [Forfeiture of assets of a criminal or terrorist organisation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_5/lvl_b/lvl_d6610e241)

[**Art. 72**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_72)

The court shall order the forfeiture of all assets that are subject to the power of disposal of a criminal or terrorist organisation. In the case of the assets of a person who participates in or supports such an organisation (Art. 260ter), it is presumed that the assets are subject to the power of disposal of the organisation until the contrary is proven.

##### [6. Use for the benefit of the person harmed](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_3/sec_2/lvl_6)

[**Art. 73**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_73) 

[1] If as a result of a felony or misdemeanour a person has suffered harm and is not entitled to benefits under an insurance policy, and if it is anticipated that the offender will not pay damages or satisfaction, the court shall award the person harmed, at his request, a sum of money up to the amount of damages or satisfaction set by a court or agreed in a settlement with the person harmed and obtained from:


|    a. the monetary penalty or fine paid by the offender;  
|    b. objects and assets that have been forfeited, or the proceeds of their sale after deduction of expenses;

### [Title Four: Execution of Custodial Sentences and Custodial Measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4)


#### [1. Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_1)

[**Art. 74**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_74) 

The human dignity of the prison inmates or of the inmates of an institution for the execution of measures must be respected. Their rights may only be limited to the extent that that is required for the deprivation of their liberty and their co-existence in the penal institution.

#### [2. Execution of custodial sentences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2)

##### [Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e250)

[**Art. 75**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_75) 

[1] The execution of sentences must encourage an improvement in the social behaviour of the prison inmates, and in particular their ability to live their lives without offending again. The conditions under which sentences are executed must correspond as far as possible with those of normal life, guarantee the supervision of the prison inmates, counteract the harmful consequences of the deprivation of liberty and take appropriate account of the need to protect the general public, the institution staff and other inmates.

[2] ...

[3] The institution rules shall provide that a sentence management plan be drawn up in consultation with the prison inmate. This plan in particular contains details of the supervision offered, the opportunities to work and receive basic or advanced training, making reparation, relations with the outside world and preparations for release.

[4] The prison inmate must actively cooperate in resocialisation efforts and the preparations for release.

[5] Account is taken of the gender-specific concerns and needs of the prison inmates.

[6] If the prison inmate is released on parole or granted final release and it subsequently comes to light that on his release he was subject to another executable judgment imposing a custodial sentence, execution of that custodial sentence is waived if:


|    a. it was not executed concurrently with the other custodial sentence for a reason within the control of the executive authorities;  
|    b. the prison inmate was able to assume in good faith that on his release he was not subject to another executable judgment imposing a custodial sentence; and  
|    c. the reintegration of the prison inmates would be prejudiced.

##### [Special security measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e252)

[**Art. 75***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_75_a)

[1] The Commission under Article 62*d* paragraph 2 shall with a view to a transfer to an open penal institution and the authorisation of a relaxation in the execution of the sentence assess the danger to the community of the offender if:


|    a. he has committed a felony in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1; and   
|    b. the executive authority cannot satisfactorily answer the question of whether he is a danger to other prison inmates.

[2] Relaxation of the execution of the sentence involves easing the regime for the deprivation of liberty, in particular by means of a transfer to an open institution, the granting of release on temporary licence, the authorisation of day release employment or of external accommodation and the granting of parole.[]

[3] Danger to the community is assumed if there is a risk that the prison inmate will abscond and commit a further offence that severely prejudices the physical, psychological or sexual integrity of another person.

##### [Place of execution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e255)

[**Art. 76**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_76) 

[1] Custodial sentences are executed in a secure or open penal institution.

[2] The prison inmate shall be admitted to a secure penal institution or to the secure section of an open penal institution if there is a risk that that he will abscond or it is expected that he will commit further offences.

##### [Normal execution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e257)

[**Art. 77**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_77) 

The prison inmate normally spends his working, rest and leisure time in the institution.

##### [Day release employment and external accommodation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e259)

[**Art. 77***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_77_a) 

[1] The custodial sentence is executed in the form of day release employment if the prison inmate has served part of the custodial sentence, normally a minimum one half, and it is not expected that he will abscond or commit further offences.

[2] In day release employment, the prison inmate works outside the institution and spends his rest and leisure time in the institution. The change to day release employment normally takes place following an appropriate period spent in an open institution or the open section of a secure institution. Work outside the institution may also include housework and caring for children.

[3] If the prison inmate proves himself to be of good behaviour in day release employment, the further execution of the sentence takes the form of external accommodation and day release employment. Here the prison inmate lives and works outside the institution, but remains under the supervision of the executive authority.

##### [Semi-detention](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e261)

[**Art. 77***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_77_b)

[1] At the offender’s request, a custodial sentence of no more than 12 months or the remainder of a sentence after taking account of time spent on remand of no more than six months may be served in the form of semi-detention provided:


|    a. it is not anticipated that the offender will abscond or commit further offences; and  
|    b. the offender does regulated work or training or is similarly occupied for at least 20 hours a week.

[2] The prison inmate works, is trained or similarly occupied outside the institution and spends his rest and leisure time in the institution.

[3] Semi-detention may be served in a special section of a remand centre provided the offender is guaranteed the required supervision.

[4] If the offender no longer meets the authorisation requirements or if he fails to comply with the conditions of semi-detention imposed by the executive authority despite being warned to do so, the custodial sentence shall be served in the normal manner.

##### [Solitary confinement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e263)

[**Art. 78**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_78) 

Solitary confinement in the form of uninterrupted separation from other prison inmates may only be ordered:


|    a. for a maximum of one week at the start of the sentence in order to initiate the execution of the sentence;  
|    b. for the protection of the prison inmate or of third parties;  
|    c. as a disciplinary sanction.

[**Art. 79**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_79)

##### [Community service](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e267)

[**Art. 79***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_79_a)

[1] If it is not anticipated that the offender will abscond or commit further offences, the following sentences may be served in the form of community service:


|    a. a custodial sentence of no more than six months;  
|    b. the remainder of a sentence of no more than six months after taking account of time spent on remand; or  
|    c. a monetary penalty or a fine.

[2] Community service is not permitted as a means of serving an alternative custodial sentence.

[3] Community service is work that benefits social institutions, public works or persons in need. The work is unpaid.

[4] Four hours of community service correspond to one day of a custodial sentence, one daily penalty unit of a monetary penalty or one day of an alternative custodial sentence in the case of contraventions.

[5] The executive authority shall allow the offender a specific period not exceeding two years within which to complete the community service. In the case of community service carried out in lieu of a fine, this period may not exceed one year. 

[6] If the offender fails to comply with the conditions of community service imposed by the executive authority despite being warned to do so, the custodial sentence shall be served in the normal manner or in the form of semi-detention, or the monetary penalty or fine shall be enforced.

##### [Electronic monitoring](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e269)

[**Art. 79***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_79_b)

[1] At the request of the offender, the executive authority may order the use of electronic devices and their secure attachment to the offender’s body (electronic monitoring):


|    a. in execution of a custodial sentence or an alternative custodial sentence of from 20 days to 12 months; or  
|    b. in lieu of day release employment or day release employment and external accommodation for a term of from 3 to 12 months.

[2] The executive authority may order electronic monitoring only if:


|    a. it is not anticipated that the offender will abscond or commit further offences;  
|    b. the offender lives in permanent accommodation;  
|    c. the offender is doing regulated work or training or is similarly occupied for at least 20 hours a week or can be assigned to do the same;  
|    d. the adults living with the offender in the same accommodation consent; and  
|    e. the offender agrees to the implementation plan drawn up for him.

[3] If the requirements of paragraph 2 letter a, b or c are no longer met or if the offender fails to fulfil the obligations set out in the implementation plan, the executive authority may discontinue the electronic monitoring and order the sentence to be served in the normal manner or in the form of semi-detention, or restrict the free time available to the offender.

##### [Other forms of sentence execution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e271)

[**Art. 80**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_80) 

[1] A departure from the rules governing the execution of sentences in favour of the prison inmates may be permitted:


|    a. if the state of health of the prison inmates so requires;  
|    b. in the event of pregnancy, childbirth and for the time immediately after childbirth;  
|    c. to enable the mother and infant to be accommodated together, provided this is also in the interests of the child.

[2] If the sentence is not served in a penal institution, but in another appropriate institution, the prison inmate is subject to the regulations of that institution unless the executive authority orders otherwise.

##### [Work](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e273)

[**Art. 81**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_81) 

[1] The prison inmate is obliged to work. Wherever possible, the work should be appropriate to his skills, education and training and his interests.

[2] If he consents to do so, the prison inmate may work for a private employer.

##### [Basic and advanced training](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e275)

[**Art. 82**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_82)

[1] The prison inmate receives a wage for his work based on his performance and according to the circumstances.

[2] The prison inmate may freely dispose of only part of his wage while serving his sentence. The remaining part is withheld until the inmate has been released. The wage may neither be pledged, seized nor included in an insolvent estate. Any assignment or pledge of the wage is null and void.

[3] If the prison inmate participates in basic or advanced training instead of work in accordance with his sentence management plan, he receives appropriate remuneration.

##### [Relations with the outside world](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e280)

[3] Clerics, doctors, attorneys, notaries and guardians as well as persons with comparable duties may be permitted to communicate freely with the prison inmates subject to the general institution rules.

[4] Contact with defence attorneys must be permitted. Visits from the defence attorney may be supervised but conversations may not be listened in on. Inspecting the content of correspondence and attorneys' documents is not permitted. Contact with attorneys may be prohibited by the competent authority in the event of abuse.

[5] Communications with the supervisory authorities may not be monitored.

[6] The prison inmate shall be granted release on temporary licence to an appropriate extent in order to cultivate relations with the outside world, prepare for his release or where there are special circumstances, provided his conduct in custody does not preclude this and there is no risk that he will abscond or commit further offences.

[6bis] Offenders subject to indefinite incarceration are not granted release on temporary licence or other relaxations of the execution of the sentence during the sentence served prior to incarceration.

[7] Article 36 of the Vienna Convention of 24 April 1963 on Consular Relations and other regulations under international law on visits and correspondence that are binding on Switzerland are reserved.

##### [Searches and inspections](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e282)

[**Art. 85**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_85) 

[1] The personal effects and the accommodation of the prison inmate may be searched in the interests of maintaining order and security in the penal institution.

[2] A prison inmate who is suspected of concealing unpermitted articles about his person or in his body, may be subjected to a body search. The search must be conducted by a person of the same gender. If the removal of clothing is required, this must be carried out in the absence of other prison inmates. Searches of body cavities must be carried out by a doctor or other medically qualified staff.

##### [Parole](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e284)

[**Art. 86**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_86) 

[1] If the prison inmate has served two thirds of his sentence, provided this amounts to at least three months, he shall be released on parole by the competent authority if this is justified by his conduct while in custody and it is not expected that he will commit further felonies or misdemeanours.

[2] The competent authority shall assess ex officio whether the inmate may be released on parole. It shall obtain a report from the institution board. The prison inmate shall be granted a hearing.

[3] If parole is refused, the competent authority must reassess the question of whether parole may be granted at least once each year.

[4] If the prison inmate has served half of his sentence, provided this amounts to at least three months, he may be released on parole by way of exception, if exceptional personal circumstances justify this.

[5] In the case of persons serving a life sentence, parole under paragraph 1 is possible at the earliest after 15 years, and under paragraph 4 at the earliest after ten years.

###### [b. Probationary period](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e284/lvl_b)

[**Art. 87**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_87) 

[1] A person released on parole is made subject to a probationary period of a duration that corresponds to the remainder of his sentence. The period however amounts to at least one year and no more than five years.

[2] The executive authority shall normally order probation assistance for the duration of the probationary period. It may impose conduct orders on the person released on parole.

[3] If parole is granted to an inmate serving a custodial sentence for an offence mentioned in Article 64 paragraph 1, and if on expiry of the probationary period a continuation of the probation assistance or the conduct orders appear to be required in order to reduce the risk of further offences of this type being committed, the court may at the request of the executive authority extend the probation assistance or the conduct orders in each case by one to five years or impose a new conduct order for this period. A recall to custody in accordance with Article 95 paragraph 5 is not possible in such cases.

###### [c. Successful completion of probation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e284/lvl_c)

[**Art. 88**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_88) 

If the person released on parole is of good behaviour throughout the probationary period, he is granted final release.

###### [d. Breach of probation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_2/lvl_d6610e284/lvl_d)

[**Art. 89**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_89) 

[1] If a person released on parole commits a felony or misdemeanour during the probationary period, the court judging the new offence shall order his recall to custody.

[2] If, despite the commission of a felony or misdemeanour during the probationary period, it is not expected that the offender will commit further offences, the court shall dispense with a recall to custody. It may admonish the offender and extend the probationary period by no more than half of the period originally fixed by the competent authority. If the extension is ordered after the expiry of the original probationary period, it begins on the day on which it is ordered. The provisions on probation assistance and conduct orders apply (Art. 93–95).

[3] If a person released on parole fails to comply with the conditions of probation assistance or disregards the conduct orders, Article 95 paragraphs 3–5 applies.

[4] A recall to custody may not be ordered if three years have elapsed since the expiry of the probationary period.

[5] Any period of time spent on remand that the offender has served during the recall to custody proceedings is taken into account in the remainder of his sentence.

[6] If the requirements for an unsuspended custodial sentence are fulfilled due to the new offence and if this coincides with the remainder of the sentence that must be executed by the recall to custody, the court shall impose a cumulative sentence in application of Article 49 a. The rules on parole again apply to this sentence. If only the remainder of the sentence is executed, Article 86 paragraphs 1–4 applies.

[7] If the remainder of a sentence that must be executed in accordance with a decision on recall to custody coincides with the execution of a measure under Articles 59–61, Article 57 paragraphs 2 and 3 applies.

#### [3. Execution of measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_1/part_1/tit_4/lvl_3)

[**Art. 90**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_90) 

[1] A person subject to the execution of a measure under Articles 59–61, may only be accommodated without interruption separately from the other inmates of an institution for the execution of measures if this is essential:


|    a. as a temporary therapeutic measure;  
|    b. for the protection of other inmates of the institution or of third parties;  
|    c. as a disciplinary sanction.

[2] At the start of the execution of the measure, a sentence management plan is drawn up in consultation with the inmate or his legal representative. This includes in particular details of the treatment of the inmate's mental disorder, dependence or developmental disorder and on measures to prevent the endangerment of others.

[2bis] Measures under Articles 59–61 and 64 may be executed in the form of external accommodation and day release employment if there is a justified opinion that this will significantly contribute to the aim of the measure being achieved, and if there is no risk that the inmate will abscond or will commit further offences. Article 77*a* paragraphs 2 and 3 applies by analogy.

[3] If the inmate is able to work, he is required to work to the extent that his in-patient treatment or care requires or permits. Articles 81–83 apply in an analogous manner.

[4] Article 84 applies by analogy to the relations of the inmates of an institution for the execution of measures with the outside world, unless additional restrictions are required for reasons relating to the in-patient treatment.

[4bis] Article 75*a* applies by analogy to admission to an open institution and to the authorisation of a relaxation in the measures regime.

[4ter] During lifelong incarceration, it is not permitted to authorise release on temporary licence or a relaxation of the sentence regime.

[5] Article 85 applies by analogy to searches and inspections.

|    b. the temporary withdrawal or restriction of the right to use money, participate in recreational activities or have external contacts;  
|    c. a fine; and  
|    d. solitary confinement as an additional restriction of liberty.

[**Art. 92***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_92_a)

[1] Victims and relatives of victims as defined in Article 1 paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Victim Support Act of 23 March 2007 (VSA) and third parties who have a legitimate interest may make a written request to the executive authority for the following information:

|    b. immediate notification of the escape of an offender and of his or her recapture.

[2] The executive authority decides on the request after consulting the offender.

[3] It may refuse to provide the information or revoke a previous decision to provide information only if the offender‘s legitimate interests justify this.

[4] If the executive authority approves a request, it shall advise the person entitled to information of the confidentiality of the information disclosed. Persons entitled to victim support under the VSA are not required to maintain confidentiality in their dealings with a counsellor at a counselling service under Article 9 VSA.

# [Book Three:](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_3) [Introduction and Application of the Code](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_3)

## [Title One: Relationship between this Code and other Federal and Cantonal Acts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_3/tit_1)


### [Application of the General Provisions to other federal acts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_3/tit_1/lvl_d6610e993)

[**Art. 333**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_333) 

[1] The general provisions of this Code apply to offences provided for in other federal acts unless these federal acts themselves contain detailed provisions on such offences.

[2] In the other federal acts, the terms below are replaced as follows:


|    a. penal servitude by a custodial sentence of more than one year;  
|    b. imprisonment by a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or by a monetary penalty;  
|    c. imprisonment for less than six months by a monetary penalty, whereby a one-month custodial sentence corresponds to a monetary penalty of 30 daily penalty units up to a maximum of 3000 francs.

[3] An offence that carries a maximum penalty of detention or a fine or of a fine only is a contravention. Articles 106 and 107 apply. Article 8 of the Federal Act of 22 March 1974 on Administrative Criminal Law is reserved. An offence is also a contravention if, in terms of another Federal Act that came into force before 1942, it carries a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months.

[4] Sentences of lengths differing from those mentioned in paragraph 2 and Article 41 as well as fines of amounts differing from those mentioned in Article 106 are reserved.

[5] If another federal act provides for a fine to be imposed for a felony or misdemeanour, Article 34 applies. Rules on determining a penalty that differ from Article 34 do not apply. Article 8 of the Federal Act of 22 March 1974 on Administrative Criminal Law remains reserved. If the fine is limited to a sum under 1 080 000 francs, this limit no longer applies. If the fine is limited to a sum exceeding 1 080 000 francs, this limit continues to apply. In this case, the maximum number of daily penalty units equals the current maximum fine divided by 3000.

[6] Until they have been amended, the following applies in other federal acts:


|    a. the limitation periods for the prosecution of felonies and misdemeanours are increased by half and the limitation periods for the prosecution of contraventions by twice the ordinary duration;  
|    b. the limitation periods for the prosecution of contraventions that exceed one year are increased by the ordinary duration;  
|    c. the rules on the interruption and suspension of the limitation period for prosecution are repealed. Article 11 paragraph 3 of the Federal Act of 22 March 1974 on Administrative Criminal Law remains reserved;  
|    d. the limitation period for prosecution no longer applies if a judgment is issued by a court of first instance before expiry of the limitation period.  
|    e. the limitation periods for the execution of penalties for felonies and misdemeanours continue to apply, and those for penalties for contraventions are increased by one half.  
|    f. the provisions on the suspension of the limitation period for the execution of a penalty continue to apply, and those on interruption are repealed.

[7] The contraventions provided for in other federal acts are offences, even if they have been committed through negligence, unless only intentional commission is an offence in terms of the provision concerned.

### [Reference to repealed provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_3/tit_1/lvl_d6610e995)

[**Art. 334**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_334) 

If reference is made in federal legislation to provisions being amended or repealed by this Code, the references relate to the provisions of this Code that regulate the matter.

### [Cantonal acts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#book_3/tit_1/lvl_d6610e997)

[**Art. 335**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en#art_335) 

[1] The cantons retain the power to legislate on contraventions that are not the subject matter of federal legislation.

[2] The cantons have the power to provide for sanctions for offences against cantonal administrative and procedural law.

Art. 53), expulsion due to conviction for an offence (prev. Art.. 55), prohibition from entering premises licensed to sell alcohol (prev. Art.. 56) are repealed when the new law comes into force.

[3] The provisions of the new law on the execution of custodial sentences (Art. 74–85, 91 and 92) and on probation assistance, conduct orders and the voluntary social supervision (Art. 93–96) also apply to offenders who were convicted under the previous law.

If they do, the court shall impose the relevant; if not, indefinite incarceration is continued in accordance with the new law.

3. Register of criminal convictions

[1] The provisions of the new law on the register of criminal convictions (Art. 365–371) also apply to convictions under the previous law.
