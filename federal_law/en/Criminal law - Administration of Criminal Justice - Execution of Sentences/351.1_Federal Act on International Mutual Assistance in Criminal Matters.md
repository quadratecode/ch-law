## [Chapter 1 Scope of Application](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_1)

### [Section 1 Subject and Limits of Cooperation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_1/sec_1)

[**Art. 1** Subject matter](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_1) 

[1] Unless other federal acts or international agreements provide otherwise, this Act shall govern all procedures of international cooperation in criminal matters, and in particular:


|    a. the extradition of persons who are the subject of criminal prosecution or have been convicted (Part Two);  
|    b. assistance aimed at supporting criminal proceedings abroad (Part Three);  
|    c. the transfer of proceedings and punishment of offences (Part Four);  
|    d. the execution of foreign criminal judgments (Part Five).

[2] …

[3] This Act applies only to criminal matters in which recourse to the courts is permitted under the law of the requesting State.

[3bis] Unless other legislation or international agreements provide otherwise, this Act applies by analogy to proceedings for cooperation in criminal matters with international courts or other inter- or supranational bodies with criminal justice functions if the proceedings relate to:


|    a. offences under the Twelfth Title[bis], Twelfth Title[ter] or Twelfth Title[quater] of the Swiss Criminal Code; or  
|    b. offences under other provisions of the criminal law and the court or the body concerned is established by a resolution of the United Nations that is binding on or supported by Switzerland.

[3ter] The Federal Council may also stipulate in an ordinance that this Act applies by analogy to procedures for cooperation on criminal matters with other international courts or other inter- or supranational bodies with criminal justice functions if:


|    a. the court or body is established on the basis of legal provisions that clearly define the powers of court or body in terms of criminal law and criminal procedure;  
|    b. the procedure before the court or body guarantees compliance with the principles of the rule of law; and  
|    c. cooperation serves to safeguard Switzerland’s interests.

[4] This Act confers no right to cooperation in criminal matters.

[**Art. 1***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_1_a) [Limitation of cooperation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_1_a) 

In the application of this Act, Swiss sovereignty, security, public order or similar essential interests must be taken into account.

### [Section 2 Inadmissibility of Requests](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_1/sec_2)

[**Art. 2** Foreign proceedings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_2)

A request for cooperation in criminal matters shall not be granted if there are reasons to believe that the foreign proceedings:


|    a. do not meet the procedural requirements of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 1950, or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 16 December 1966;  
|    b. are being conducted so as to prosecute or punish a person on account of his political opinions, his belonging to a certain social group, his race, religion, or nationality;  
|    c. could result in aggravating the situation of the defendant for any of the reasons mentioned under letter b; or   
|    d. have other serious defects.

[**Art. 3** Nature of the offence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_3) 

[1] A request shall not be granted if the subject of the proceedings is an act which, in the Swiss view, is of a predominantly political nature, constitutes a violation of the obligation to perform military or similar service, or appears to be directed against the national security or military defence of the requesting State.

[2] The plea that an act is of a political nature shall not be taken into account under any circumstances:


|    a. in cases of genocide;  
|    b. in cases of crimes against humanity;  
|    c. in cases of war crimes; or  
|    d. if the act appears particularly reprehensible because the offender, for the purpose of extortion or duress, has endangered or threatened to endanger the life or limb of persons, especially by hijacking aircraft, using means of mass extermination, causing a catastrophe or taking hostages.

[3] A request shall not be granted if the subject of the proceedings is an offence which appears to be aimed at reducing fiscal duties or taxes or which violates regulations on currency, trade or economic measures. However, a request may be granted: 


|    a. for mutual assistance under Part Three of this Act if duty or tax fraud is the subject of the proceedings;  
|    b. under any part of this Act if aggravated duty or tax fraud as defined in Article 14 paragraph 4 of the Federal Act of 22 March 1974 on Administrative Criminal Law is the subject of the proceedings.

[**Art. 4** Minor cases](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_4)

A request shall be rejected if the importance of the offence does not justify conducting proceedings.

[**Art. 5** Extinction of the right to prosecute](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_5) 

[1] A request shall not be granted if: 


|    a. in Switzerland or in the State where the offence was committed, the court  
|    1. has acquitted the defendant or abandoned the proceedings for material reasons, or  
|    2. has permanently or provisionally dispensed with imposing a sentence;


|    b. the sentence was executed or cannot be executed under the laws of the State where sentence was passed;  
|    c. its execution requires compulsory measures and the prosecution or execution of the sentence was absolutely time barred under Swiss law.

[2] Paragraph 1 letters a and b do not apply if the requesting State claims that there are grounds for a review of the final sentence within the meaning of Article 410 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 5 October 2007 (CrimPC).

[**Art. 6** Concurrence of inadmissibility and admissibility of cooperation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_6) 

[1] If the act of which the defendant is accused constitutes an offence under two or more provisions of Swiss criminal law, the request may be granted only in respect of those offences for which there are no reasons for inadmissibility and if there is a guarantee that the requesting State will respect the conditions imposed.

[2] Cooperation shall not be permitted if the proceedings concern an act that constitutes an offence under two or more provisions of Swiss or foreign criminal law and if, with regard to one of these offences, which covers the act in all its aspects, a request may not be granted.

### [Section 3 Special Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_1/sec_3)

[**Art. 7** Swiss nationals](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_7) 

[1] No Swiss national may, without his written consent, be extradited or surrendered to a foreign State for prosecution or for the execution of a sentence. Consent may be withdrawn up to the time when the surrender is ordered.

[2] Paragraph 1 does not apply to transit or return of a Swiss national who is temporarily surrendered by a third State to the Swiss authorities.

[**Art. 8** Reciprocity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_8) 

[1] As a rule, a request shall be granted only if the requesting State guarantees reciprocity. The Federal Office of Justice of the Federal Department of Justice and Police (Federal Office) shall obtain a guarantee of reciprocity if this is considered necessary.

[2] Reciprocity is in particular not required for the service of documents or if the execution of a request:


|    a. seems advisable due to the type of offence or to the necessity of combating certain offences;  
|    b. is likely to improve the situation of the defendant or the prospects of his social rehabilitation; or  
|    c. serves to clarify an offence against a Swiss national.

[3] The Federal Council may, within the scope of this Act, provide other States with a guarantee of reciprocity.

[**Art. 8***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_8_a) [Bilateral treaties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_8_a) 

The Federal Council may conclude bilateral agreements with foreign States regarding the transfer of sentenced persons provided those agreements respect the principles of the European Convention of 21 March 1983 on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.

[**Art. 9** Protection of privacy](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_9) 

In the execution of requests, protection of privacy shall be governed by the provisions on the right of witnesses to refuse to testify. Articles 246–248 CrimPC apply by analogy to the search and to the placing under seal of documents.

[**Art. 10**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_10)

[**Art. 11** Legal definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_11) 

[1] A defendant under this Act is any person under suspicion, subject to criminal proceedings or on whom a sentence has been imposed.

[2] A sentence is any penalty or other measure.

## [Chapter 1*a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_1_a) [Personal Data, File and Process Management System](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_1_a)

[**Art. 11***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_11_a) 

[1] The Federal Office of Justice shall run a personal data, file and process management system that may contain sensitive personal data obtained through forms of cooperation governed by this Act. This data may be processed in order to:

|    b. process data on processes;  
|    c. organise work procedures rationally and efficiently;  
|    d. conduct a process check;

[2] In order to comply with the processing purposes mentioned in paragraph 1, the system shall contain:


|    a. personal details of persons on whom data is being processed;  
|    b. data necessary for the localisation and proper administration of the dossier;  
|    c. documents on electronically stored processes and entries.

[3] The Federal Office of Police and the State Secretariat for Migration and the units of the Federal Intelligence Service responsible for the implementation of the Federal Act of 21 March 1997 on Measures to Safeguard Internal Security shall have online access to the data defined in paragraph 2 letter a. If the Federal Office of Police carries out the tasks of the Federal Office of Justice under this Act, it shall also have online access to the data defined in paragraph 2 letter b.

[4] The Federal Council shall specify the details, and in particular:


|    a. in the case of the recording of data in accordance with paragraph 2 letters a and b, data on the judicial authorities involved in the mutual assistance proceedings and data on the offences giving rise to the request for mutual assistance;  
|    b. the period of time that the data is kept and the archiving of the data;  
|    c. the agencies of the Federal Office that are authorised to process the data directly in the system and the data that in individual cases may be disclosed to other authorities.

## [Chapter 1*b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_1_b) [Protection of Personal Data](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_1_b)

[**Art. 11***b* Right to information in pending proceedings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_11_b) 

[1] Where mutual assistance proceedings are pending, the person who is the object of a request for international cooperation in criminal matters shall be allowed access to the personal data related to them and the following information:


|    a. the purpose of and legal basis for the data processing;  
|    b. the period that the personal data will be retained or, if this is not possible, the criteria for determining this period;  
|    c. the recipients or the categories of recipients;  
|    d. the available information on the origin of the personal data;  
|    e. the information that they require to be able to assert their rights.

[2] The competent authority may refuse to provide the information, limit the information provided or defer provision of the information if there are grounds for doing so under Article 80*b* paragraph 2 or if:


|    a. it is necessary because of overriding interests of third parties;  
|    b. it is necessary because of overriding public interests, in particular relating to the internal or external security of Switzerland; or  
|    c. an enquiry, an investigation, court proceedings or international cooperation proceedings in criminal matters may be prejudiced by providing the person concerned with information.

[**Art. 11***c* Restriction of the right to information in relation to requests for arrest for the purpose of extradition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_11_c) 

[1] Any person may request information on whether Switzerland has received a request from a foreign state to make an arrest for the purpose of extradition. This right may be asserted at the Federal Office. If the request is made to a different authority, that authority shall forward the request immediately to the Federal Office. 

[2] If a person requests information on whether the Federal Office has received a request to make an arrest for the purpose of extradition, the Federal Office shall notify the person that no data about them has been unlawfully processed and that the person can request the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) to enquire as to whether any data on them has been lawfully processed. 

[3] The Commissioner shall conduct the enquiries; he shall notify the person concerned either that no data about them has been unlawfully processed or that he has opened an investigation under Article 22 of the Schengen Data Protection Act of 28 September 2018 in the case of errors in the processing of personal data. 

[4] If the Commissioner identifies errors in the data processing, he shall order the Federal Office to rectify the same.

[5] The notifications under paragraphs 2 and 3 shall always be worded in the same way and shall not mention the grounds. 

[6] The notification under paragraph 3 may not be contested. 

[7] In derogation from paragraph 2, the Federal Office is entitled to provide the person concerned with the requested information if the requesting state gives its advance consent.

[**Art. 11***d* Right to have personal data corrected or deleted](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_11_d) 

[1] The person who is the object of a request for international cooperation in criminal matters may request that the competent authority correct or delete the personal data relating to them that is being processed in contravention of this Act.

[2] Instead of deleting the personal data, the competent authority shall restrict the processing if:


|    a. the data subject disputes the accuracy of the personal data but it cannot be established whether the data is correct or incorrect;  
|    b. overriding interests, in particular those set out in Article 80*b* paragraph 2, so require; or  
|    c. deletion may prejudice proceedings on international cooperation in criminal matters or foreign proceedings giving rise to the request for cooperation in criminal matters.

[3] The competent authority shall immediately notify the authority that has transmitted, made available or disclosed the personal data about the measures taken in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2.

[4] The relevant foreign authority is responsible for checking the accuracy of personal data that has been obtained as evidence or personal data relating to criminal offences giving rise to the request for international cooperation in criminal matters.

[**Art. 11***e* Equal treatment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_11_e) 

[1] The data protection rules that apply to the disclosure of personal data to the competent authorities of States that are linked with Switzerland through one of the Schengen association agreements (the Schengen States) must not be stricter than the rules that apply to the disclosure of personal data to Swiss law enforcement authorities.

[2] Specific legislation that provides for stricter data protection rules for the disclosure of personal data to the competent foreign authorities does not apply to disclosure to the competent authorities of the Schengen States.

[**Art. 11***f* Disclosure of personal data to a third country or an international body](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_11_f) 

[1] Personal data may not be disclosed to the competent authority of a State that is not linked with Switzerland through one of the Schengen association agreements (a third country) or to an international body if, as a result, the privacy of the data subject would be seriously jeopardised, in particular because of the lack of adequate protection. 

[2] Adequate protection is guaranteed by: 


|    a. the legislation of the third country, provided the European Union has confirmed this in a decision;   
|    b. an international agreement;  
|    c. specific guarantees.

[3] In derogation from paragraph 1, personal data may be disclosed to the competent authority of a third country or to an international body if disclosure is necessary in the case in question:


|    a. to protect the life or physical integrity of the data subject or a third party;   
|    b. to prevent an imminent and serious threat to the public security of a Schengen State or of a third country;  
|    c. to prevent, detect or prosecute a criminal offence or to execute a criminal judgment, unless overriding legitimate interests of the data subject preclude disclosure;  
|    d. to exercise or enforce legal rights against an authority competent to prevent, detect or prosecute a criminal offence or to execute a criminal judgment, unless overriding legitimate interests of the data subject preclude disclosure.

[**Art. 11***g* Disclosure of personal data by a Schengen State to a third country or an international body](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_11_g) 

[1] Personal data that are transmitted or made available by a Schengen State may be disclosed to the competent authority of a third country or to an international body if: 


|    a. disclosure is required to prevent, detect or prosecute a criminal offence or to execute a criminal judgment;  
|    b. the Schengen State that transmitted or made available the personal data has given prior consent to disclosure; and  
|    c. the requirements of Article 11*f* are met. 

[2] In derogation from paragraph 1 letter b, personal data may be disclosed in an individual case if: 


|    a. the prior consent of the Schengen State cannot be obtained in time; and  
|    b. disclosure is necessary to prevent an imminent and serious threat to the public security of a Schengen State or of a third country or to protect the essential interests of a Schengen State.

[3] The Schengen State shall be notified immediately of any disclosure under paragraph 2.

[**Art. 11***h* Procedure for the disclosure of personal data](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_11_h) 

[1] The competent authority shall notify the recipient about the reliability of the personal data disclosed and of the extent to which they are up to date.

[2] It shall also disclose any additional information to the recipient that may as far as possible be used to distinguish:


|    a. between the various categories of data subjects;  
|    b. between personal data based on facts and personal data based on personal assessments.

[3] The obligation to notify the recipient does not apply if the information mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 is evident from the personal data themselves or from the circumstances.

## [Chapter 2 Applicable Law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_2)

[**Art. 12** General](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_12) 

[1] Unless this Act specifies otherwise, the federal administrative authorities shall apply, by analogy, the Federal Act of 20 December 1968 on Administrative Procedure, and the cantonal authorities their own procedural rules. Procedural acts are governed by the procedural law in criminal matters.

[2] The cantonal and federal provisions on the suspension of time limits do not apply.

[**Art. 13** Suspension of limitation periods](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_13)[. Filing a criminal complaint](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_13) 

[1] In proceedings under this Act, the following shall be considered to have effect in Switzerland:


|    a. the suspension of a limitation period under the law of the requesting State;  
|    b. the filing of a criminal complaint with a foreign authority within the time limit provided for if this is so required under Swiss law.

[2] If a criminal complaint is required only under Swiss law, no sentence may be imposed or executed in Switzerland if the victim makes objections.

[**Art. 14** Taking account of the period in detention](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_14) 

Article 69 of the Swiss Criminal Code applies when taking account of the period spent on remand or in detention abroad due to proceedings under this Act. 

[**Art. 15** Compensation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_15) 

[1] Articles 429 and 431 CrimPC apply by analogy in proceedings that have been conducted against the defendant under this Act in Switzerland or at the instigation of a Swiss authority abroad.

[2] The Confederation shall pay the compensation if a federal authority makes or executes a request. It may require reimbursement from the canton that caused the request to be made.

[3] The compensation may be reduced or refused if the defendant has provoked the investigation or the detention through his fault, or has, without reason, obstructed or delayed the proceedings.

[4] Compensation for detention pending extradition served in Switzerland may also be reduced or refused if the requesting State:


|    a. withdraws the request for search and arrest with a view to extradition; or  
|    b. does not present the request for extradition with the necessary enclosures within the deadline set. 

[5] The likelihood of the injured party being able to obtain damages in the foreign State must be taken into account when the decision is made to reduce or refuse the compensation.

## [Chapter 3 Domestic Procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_3)

### [Section 1 Authorities and Powers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_1/chap_3/sec_1)

[**Art. 16** Cantonal authorities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_16) 

[1] The cantons shall participate in the conduct of extradition proceedings. Unless federal law provides otherwise, they are required to execute the requests for other forms of mutual assistance and the transfer of proceedings and to execute criminal judgments. The cantons shall be subject to the supervision of the Confederation provided this Act applies.

[2] …

[**Art. 17** Federal authorities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_17) 

[1] The Federal Department of Justice and Police (the Department) shall decide on cases under Article 1 letter *a*. The decision of the Department may be requested within 30 days of receiving written notification of the final ruling.

[2] The Federal Office shall receive the requests from abroad and file Swiss requests. It shall handle extradition requests and arrange for requests for other assistance, transfer of proceedings and execution of criminal judgments to be examined by the appropriate cantonal or federal authorities if their execution is not obviously inadmissible.

[3] It shall decide:


|    a. whether to require a guarantee of reciprocity (Art. 8 para. 1);  
|    b. on the appropriate procedure (Art. 19);  
|    c. on the admissibility of Swiss requests (Art. 30, para. 1).

[4] It may transfer the conduct of proceedings wholly or partly to the federal authority which would be competent to prosecute the offence if it had been committed in Switzerland.

[5] It may also decide on the admissibility of assistance and allow its execution in accordance with Article 79 letter *a*.

[**Art. 17***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_17_a) [Obligation of promptness](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_17_a) 

[1] The competent authority shall execute requests promptly. It shall decide without delay.

[2] It shall on request provide the Federal Office with information on the status of the proceedings, the reasons for any delay and the measures being considered. If the delay is not justified, the Federal Office may take the matter up with the appropriate supervisory authority.

[3] When the competent authority, without reason, refuses to or delays in issuing a ruling, its conduct shall be regarded as equivalent to a negative decision subject to appeal.

[**Art. 18**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_18) [Provisional measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_18) 

[1] At the express request of another State, provisional measures may be taken by the competent authority to preserve the existing situation, to safeguard threatened legal interests or to protect jeopardised evidence unless the proceedings under this Act clearly appear to be inadmissible or inappropriate.

[2] If any delay would jeopardise the proceedings and if there is sufficient information to determine whether all the conditions are met, the Federal Office may likewise order provisional measures as soon as a request is announced. Such measures shall be revoked if the foreign State does not make the request within the deadline set.

[3] Appeals filed against rulings based on this Article do not have suspensive effect.

[**Art. 18***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_18_a) [Surveillance of postal and telecommunications traffic](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_18_a) 

[1] In extradition cases, the Federal Office may, at the express request of another State order the surveillance of postal and telecommunications traffic in order to establish the whereabouts of the defendant.

[2] In other mutual assistance cases, the following authorities may order the surveillance of postal and telecommunications traffic: 


|    a. the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland or of the Cantonal Public Prosecutor;   
|    b. the Federal Office, if it is executing the request for mutual assistance itself.

[3] The surveillance order must be submitted to the following authorities for approval:


|    a. by the federal authorities: the federal compulsory measures court;

[1] The federal or cantonal authority dealing with a request for mutual assistance may order the transmission of electronic communications traffic data to another State before conclusion of the mutual assistance proceedings if:


|    a. provisional measures indicate that the communication that is the subject of the request originated abroad; or  
|    b. the data was acquired by the executing authority based on an order for authorised real-time surveillance (Art. 269–281 CrimPC).

There is no right of appeal against the decision and ancillary measures. They shall be notified only to the requesting State.

[2] No approval shall be required if the detained person is to be transported by aircraft over Swiss territory without a stopover landing. In the event of an unscheduled stopover landing, the detained person may be kept in custody only if:

[3] Persons who are the subject of foreign criminal proceedings may challenge rulings only if they are personally and directly affected by a mutual assistance measure and if they have an interest worthy of legal protection in the measure being revoked or changed.

[4] Appeals filed against a decision made in application of this Act shall not have a suspensive effect. This rule does not apply to appeals directed against a decision:


|    a. granting extradition; or

|    a. is punishable by deprivation of liberty for a maximum period of at least one year or a more severe sentence both under the law of Switzerland and under the law of the requesting State and  
|    b. is not subject to Swiss jurisdiction.

[1] Extradition may be denied if Switzerland can assume responsibility for the prosecution of the offence or the execution of the foreign criminal judgment and if this appears to be appropriate with regard to the social rehabilitation of the defendant.

[2] Extradition shall be denied if the request is based on a verdict issued in the absence of the defendant and if the minimum rights of the defence to which a defendant is recognised to be entitled were not respected in the proceedings preceding the verdict; this rule does not apply if the requesting State gives sufficient assurances to guarantee the defendant the right to new court proceedings where the rights of the defence are respected.

[1] If two or more States request extradition for the same offence, extradition shall be granted as a rule to the State where the offence was committed or principally perpetrated. 

[2] If extradition is requested by more than one State for different offences, the decision shall be made having due regard to all circumstances, especially the seriousness of the offences, the place of commission, the chronological order in which the requests were received, the nationality of the defendant, the better prospect of social rehabilitation and the possibility of extradition to another State.

|    c. a person not involved in the offence and whose claims are not guaranteed by the requesting State shows probable cause that he has acquired rights over the objects and assets in good faith in Switzerland, or, if he is habitually resident in Switzerland, in a foreign country.

[5] Objects or assets mentioned in the first paragraph and which are required for pending criminal proceedings in Switzerland may also be retained in Switzerland.

[6] If a person entitled to the objects or assets makes a claim under paragraph 4, the objects or assets shall not be handed over until the legal position has been clarified. Objects or assets in dispute shall be returned to the person entitled only if: 


|    a. the requesting State gives its consent;  
|    b. in the case of paragraph 4 letter b, the authority gives its consent; or  
|    c. the justification of the claim is recognised by a Swiss judicial authority.

[7] The handing over of objects and assets is not dependent on the execution of the extradition of the defendant.

[**Art. 61** Time limit for taking over](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_61) 

If the requesting State does not take the necessary steps to take over the person to be extradited within ten days of notification of the execution order, he shall be released. This time limit may be extended up to 30 days in response to a justified request from the requesting State. 

[**Art. 62** Costs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_62)

[1] Mutual assistance within the meaning of Part Three of this Act shall comprise the transmission of information, as well as procedural acts and other official acts permitted under Swiss law provided these acts appear to be necessary for proceedings carried out abroad in criminal matters or serve to retrieve the proceeds of the offence.

[2] Mutual assistance measures shall include in particular:


|    a. the service of documents;  
|    b. obtaining evidence, and in particular searching persons and rooms, seizure, orders to produce, expert opinions, conducting hearings and confrontations of persons;  
|    c. production of documents and papers;  
|    d. handing over of objects or assets with a view to forfeiture or for restitution to the entitled person.

[3] The following shall, in particular, be considered proceedings carried out in criminal matters:


|    a. prosecution of criminal offences as provided for in Article 1 paragraph 3;  
|    b. administrative measures against an offender;  
|    c. execution of criminal judgments and pardons;  
|    d. compensation for unjustified detention.

[5] Assistance which will exonerate a defendant is permitted even if the request is inadmissible under Articles 3–5.

[**Art. 64** Compulsory measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_64) 

[1] Measures under Article 63 which require the use of procedural compulsion may be ordered only if the description of the circumstances of the case indicates that the offence being prosecuted abroad contains the objective elements of an offence under Swiss law. The measures must be carried out in accordance with Swiss law.

[2] If the offence prosecuted abroad is not an offence in Switzerland, measures under Article 63 which require the use of procedural compulsion shall be allowed for: 


|    a. the exoneration of a defendant;  
|    b. the prosecution of offences involving sexual acts with minors.

[**Art. 65**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_65) [Application of foreign law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_65) 

[1] At the express request of the foreign State:


|    a. the statements of witnesses or experts shall be affirmed in the form prescribed by the laws of the requesting State, even if the applicable Swiss law does not provide such a form;  
|    b. forms necessary to obtain other evidence that is admissible in court may be taken into consideration.

[2] Forms for obtaining and affirming evidence according to paragraph 1 must be compatible with Swiss law, and no essential prejudice may result therefrom to the persons involved.

[3] A person may also refuse to testify provided the law of the requesting State so provides or if the fact of testifying may cause criminal or disciplinary sanctions to be imposed under the laws of that State or of the State where the examined person lives.

[**Art. 65***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_65_a) [Presence of persons participating in proceedings abroad](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_65_a) 

[1] When the requesting State, based on its law, so requests, persons who are participating in proceedings abroad may be authorised to attend mutual assistance proceedings and to have access to the files.

[2] Their presence may also be permitted if it substantially helps to facilitate the execution of the request or the foreign criminal proceedings.

[3] Their presence may not lead to their obtaining access to information within the scope of secrecy before the appropriate authority has decided whether, and to what extent, assistance may be granted.

[**Art. 66** Principle of «*Ne bis in idem*»](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_66)

[1] Assistance may be denied if the defendant resides in Switzerland and proceedings are already pending here regarding the offence to which the request relates. 

[2] However, assistance may be granted if the proceedings carried out abroad are not directed solely against the defendant who is residing in Switzerland, or if the execution of the request serves to exonerate him.

[**Art. 67**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_67) [Principle of speciality](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_67) 

[1] Information and documents obtained through mutual assistance may not be used for investigative purposes or as evidence in the requesting State in any proceedings relating to an offence for which assistance is not admissible.

[2] Any further use shall be subject to approval by the Federal Office. This approval is not necessary if:


|    a. the act to which the request relates constitutes another offence for which mutual assistance would be granted; or  
|    b. the foreign criminal proceedings are directed against other persons who have participated in committing the offence.

[3] Presence at the mutual assistance proceedings and access to the files shall be permitted under the same conditions (Art. 65*a* para.1).

[**Art. 67***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_67_a) [Spontaneous transmission of information and evidence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_67_a) 

[1] An authority prosecuting offences may, without being requested to do so, transmit to a foreign authority prosecuting offences information or evidence that it has gathered in the course of its own investigation, when it determines that this transmission may:


|    a. permit the opening of criminal proceedings; or  
|    b. facilitate an ongoing criminal investigation.

[2] The transmission as defined in paragraph 1 does not have any effect on the criminal proceedings pending in Switzerland.

[3] The transmission of evidence to a State with which Switzerland does not have an international agreement shall be subject to authorisation by the Federal Office.

[4] Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply to evidence that is subject to the rules on secrecy. 

[5] Information that is subject to the rules on secrecy may be transmitted if it may enable the foreign State to present a request for mutual assistance.

[6] A record shall be made of each spontaneous transmission.

[3] In those cases the detained person may be released only with the agreement of the competent foreign authority.

|    b. an authority asserts rights over them;  
|    c. a person not involved in the offence and whose claims are not guaranteed by the requesting State shows probable cause that he has acquired rights over these objects and assets in good faith in Switzerland, or if he is habitually resident in Switzerland, in a foreign country; or  
|    d. the objects or assets are necessary for pending criminal proceedings in Switzerland or appear, because of their nature, to be subject to forfeiture in Switzerland.

[1] At the request of the State in which the offence was committed, Switzerland may prosecute on its behalf an offence committed abroad if:


|    a. extradition is not permitted;  
|    b. the defendant has to face charges in Switzerland for other more serious offences; and  
|    c. it is guaranteed that the requesting State will not prosecute him for the same offence after acquittal or completing a sentence in Switzerland.

[2] A foreign national who is habitually resident in Switzerland may also be prosecuted in Switzerland if his extradition cannot be justified and prosecution in Switzerland seems appropriate with regard to his personal situation and social rehabilitation.

[3] These provisions do not apply if the offence is subject to Swiss jurisdiction on the basis of another provision.

[**Art. 86** Applicable law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_86) 

[1] The offence shall be judged according to Swiss law as if it had been committed in Switzerland.

[2] The foreign law applies if it is more lenient. The court may impose only the sentences provided for by Swiss law.

[3] Proceedings in the absence of the defendant are not permitted.

[**Art. 87**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_87) [Jurisdiction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_87) 

If Swiss jurisdiction is not yet established, it shall be determined in accordance with Article 32 CrimPC.

### [Section 2 Transfer to Foreign States](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_4/chap_1/sec_2)

[**Art. 88**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_88) [Conditions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_88) 

Another State may be requested to prosecute an offence subject to Swiss jurisdiction if its laws allow the prosecution and judicial punishment of the offence and if:


|    a. the defendant is present there and his extradition to Switzerland is inappropriate or not permitted; or   
|    b. he is extradited to this State and the transfer of the prosecution offers the prospect of better social rehabilitation.

[**Art. 89** Effects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_89) 

[1] If another State prosecutes the offence, the Swiss authorities may not take further measures against the defendant for the same offence:

|    b. if, according to the decision made in the requested State, the conditions of Article 5 letter a or b are met.

[2] The effect of the time limitation provisions under Swiss law is suspended provided the proceedings including enforcement of the sentence are ongoing in the requested State.

[3] If the defendant was extradited to the requested State for other offences, this State need not observe the conditions of extradition in accordance with Article 38 provided it grants the request for prosecution.

## [Chapter 2 Procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_4/chap_2)

[1] The Federal Office shall decide on whether to accept the foreign request after consulting the prosecuting authorities.

[2] If it accepts the request, it shall transmit the file to the prosecuting authority and notify the requesting State and the person concerned.

[3] The decision does not create an obligation to institute criminal proceedings.

[4] The Federal Office may refuse to assume responsibility for the prosecution if there is good cause not to do so or if the seriousness of the offence does not justify it.

[**Art. 92** Foreign investigative measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_92) 

Any investigative measure carried out by the authorities of the requesting State under its law shall be considered equivalent to a corresponding Swiss investigative measure.

# [Part Five Enforcement of Criminal Judgments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_5)

## [Chapter 1 Conditions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_5/chap_1)

### [Section 1 Enforcement by Switzerland](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_5/chap_1/sec_1)

[**Art. 94** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_94) 

[1] Final and enforceable criminal judgments from another State may be enforced at that State's request if:


|    a. the convicted person is habitually resident in Switzerland or has to face charges here for a serious offence;  
|    b. the subject of the conviction is an offence committed abroad which, if committed in Switzerland, would be punishable here; and  
|    c. enforcement in Switzerland seems to be appropriate for one of the reasons specified in Article 85 paragraphs 1 and 2 or likely to be barred in the requesting State.

[2] Sentences imposed abroad shall be executed provided they do not exceed the maximum penalty provided by Swiss law for a corresponding offence. Sentences that remain below the minimum penalty according to Swiss law may be executed.

[3] …

[4] Fines as well as costs arising from proceedings under Article 63 may also be enforced if the convicted person is habitually resident abroad but has assets at his disposal in Switzerland and if the requesting State grants reciprocity.

[**Art. 95** Inadmissibility of the enforcement order](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_95) 

[1] The order permitting enforcement (exequatur) may not be issued if:


|    a. the conviction took place at a time when, under Swiss law, the prosecution would have been time barred;  
|    b. the sentence would have been time barred under Swiss law if a Swiss authority had imposed it at the same time; or  
|    c. the offence is also subject to Swiss jurisdiction and no sentence could be imposed under Swiss law for other reasons.

[2] Decisions on costs shall be declared enforceable only if the costs are to be paid to the State.

[**Art. 96** Refusal to enforce](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_96) 

The court shall refuse to enforce in whole or in part if:


|    a. the convicted person has incurred a sentence involving deprivation of liberty in Switzerland for other offences and enforcement as requested would result in an obviously more severe punishment than if the offences taken as a whole were judged in Switzerland; or  
|    b. the execution of any of the accessory criminal measures in Switzerland is not permitted, or  
|    c. it is of the opinion that the convicted person has good reason to oppose the enforcement of a judgment or penalty order that was issued in his absence and which is no longer subject to a right of objection or appeal under the law of the requesting State.

[**Art. 97** Binding force of the findings in fact](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_97) 

In assessing criminal liability and the possibility of prosecution under Swiss law, the court shall be bound to the findings in fact on which the decision relies. If they do not suffice, the gathering of evidence may be ordered.

[**Art. 98** Effects of enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_98) 

If Switzerland assumes responsibility for enforcement, no criminal proceedings against the convicted person for the same offence may be instituted or continued here.

[**Art. 99** Use of Swiss institutions by foreign States](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_99) 

[1] If the conditions of Article 94 paragraph 1 are not met, sentences involving restriction of liberty that have been imposed on a non-Swiss national in another State may be enforced in Switzerland under Swiss law if the other State cannot execute them itself.

[2] In this case, the final and enforceable foreign decision shall constitute the legal basis for the restriction of the convicted person’s liberty.

[3] If persons are surrendered to Switzerland in accordance with paragraph 1, then unless arrangements to the contrary have been made with the competent authorities of the surrendering State, they may neither be prosecuted nor punished nor extradited to a third State by the Swiss authorities for offences that they committed before their surrender and that were not the subject of their conviction. These effects shall expire ten days after release on parole or final release from the institution.

[4] The Federal Council shall regulate the details.

### [Section 2 Transfer to a Foreign State](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_5/chap_1/sec_2)

[**Art. 100**  Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_100) 

Another State may be requested to enforce a Swiss criminal judgment if:


|    a. it is certain to accept the binding force of the judgment in accordance with Article 97; and  
|    b. the transfer of enforcement is likely to improve the prospects of the social rehabilitation of the convicted person or if Switzerland cannot obtain his extradition.

[**Art. 101**  Conditions for transfer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_101) 

1 The convicted person who is detained in Switzerland may only be transferred with a view to enforcement of the judgment under Article 100 if he agrees and if the requested State is expected to accept the conditions set by the Federal Office.

2 The convicted person may be transferred without his consent if an international agreement ratified by Switzerland so provides. In this case the conditions and effects of the transfer are regulated exclusively by the said international agreement.

[**Art. 102** Effects of transfer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_102) 

[1] If another State enforces the criminal judgment, the Swiss authority shall abandon enforcement provided the requested State has not given notice that it will not conclude it.

[2] The convicted person may be taken into custody so as to ensure his transfer.

[3] Article 89 paragraphs 2 and 3 apply by analogy.

## [Chapter 2 Procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_5/chap_2)

[**Art. 104** Decision on the request](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#art_104) 

[1] After consulting with the authority which will execute the request, the Federal Office shall decide whether to accept the foreign request. If it accepts, it shall convey the file and its opinion to the executing authority and inform the requesting State. Article 91 paragraph 4 applies by analogy.

[2] If there is Swiss jurisdiction and if a sentence which is more severe than the one provided by Swiss law was imposed abroad, the prosecution may be taken over instead of the enforcement of the judgment if the requesting State so requests.

### [Section 2 Procedure of Exequatur](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1982/846_846_846/en#part_5/chap_2/sec_2)

[1] The sentence determined by the court shall be executed in accordance with Swiss law.

[2] Execution shall be discontinued if the decision is no longer enforceable in the requesting State.

In addition to the costs for the execution of the sentence, the costs of exequatur proceedings and other enforcement measures shall also be regarded as costs in accordance with Article 31.
