In this Act:


|    a. *embryo* means the offspring, from the fusion of the cell nuclei (karyogamy) to the completion of organ development;  
|    b. *surplus embryo* means an embryo produced in the course of an *in vitro* fertilization (IVF) procedure that cannot be used to establish a pregnancy and therefore has no prospect of survival;  
|    c. *embryonic stem cell* means a cell from an IVF embryo with the ability to differentiate into the various cell types, but not to develop into a human being, and the cell line derived therefrom;  
|    d. *parthenote* means an organism derived from an unfertilized oocyte.

[**Art. 3** Prohibited acts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/104/en#art_3)
