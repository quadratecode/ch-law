[**Art. 21** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/131/en#art_21) 

At hiring and during a professional relationship, the employer and his or her medical consultant may not:


|    a. require presymptomatic genetic tests to be performed;  
|    b. require the results of prior presymptomatic genetic tests to be disclosed nor make use of such results;  
|    c. require genetic tests to be performed with the intention of detecting personal characteristics of the employee which do not relate to his or her health.

[**Art. 22** Exceptions for presymptomatic genetic tests to prevent occupational diseases and accidents](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/131/en#art_22) 

At hiring and during a professional relationship, the occupational health or designated doctor may prescribe a presymptomatic genetic test if the following conditions are met:


|    a. Suva has ruled that the post is subject to occupational health monitoring, or other federal regulations require the employee to undergo a medical examination to ascertain his or her suitability for the job because there is a danger of an occupational disease or severe environmental contamination occurring or there is a serious risk of accident or health hazards for third parties.   
|    b. Workplace-related measures within the meaning of Article 82 of the Federal Act of 20 March 1981 on Accident Insurance or other legal provisions are not sufficient to preclude these risks.  
|    c. Available scientific knowledge has established a causal relationship between a specific genetic predisposition of the person carrying out the job and occupational disease, danger of environmental contamination or a risk of accident or health hazards to third parties.  
|    d. The Expert Commission for Human Genetic Testing has confirmed the causal relationship and has deemed the type of test to be reliable in identifying the relevant genetic predisposition.  
|    e. The person concerned has given his or her written consent to the test.

[**Art. 23** Performance of the test](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/131/en#art_23)
