1 Any person who uses fertilisers must give due consideration to:


|    a. the nutrients present in the soil and the nutrient requirements of plants (recommendations on fertiliser application);  
|    b. the site (vegetation, topography and soil conditions);  
|    c. meteorological conditions;  
|    d. limits ordered or agreed under legislation on water protection, nature and cultural heritage protection or environmental protection.

2 Any person who has supplies of farm manure may only use recycling or mineral fertilisers if the farm manure is insufficient or not suitable for meeting the nutrient requirements of the plants concerned.

3 Inputs of pollutants to agricultural soils must be avoided as far as possible.

#### [3.2 Restrictions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/478/en#lvl_d4e389/lvl_d4e390/lvl_3/lvl_d4e402)

1 Use of nitrogenous fertilisers is only permitted during periods when plants can absorb nitrogen. If the particular crop production conditions require fertiliser treatment outside these periods, use of such fertilisers is only permitted if they pose no risk to water quality.

2 Use of fluid fertilisers is only permitted if the soil has the necessary absorption capacity. In particular, they must not be used when the soil is waterlogged, frozen, snow-covered or dried-out.

##### [3.2.2 Compost and digestate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/478/en#lvl_d4e389/lvl_d4e390/lvl_3/lvl_d4e402/lvl_d4e404)

1 Over a three-year period, up to 25 tonnes of compost or solid digestate (based on dry matter) may be applied as fertiliser per hectare, or 200m3 liquid digestate per hectare, provided that these quantities do not exceed the nitrogen and phosphorus requirements of the plants.

2 It is prohibited to use, over a ten-year period, more than 100 tonnes of organic or organic mineral soil improvement agents, compost or solid digestate per hectare, either for soil improvement, as a substrate, for erosion protection, for recultivation purposes or for artificial topsoil mixtures.

## [Refrigerants](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/478/en#lvl_d4e437/lvl_d4e438)

### [1 Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2005/478/en#lvl_d4e437/lvl_d4e438/lvl_1)

1 *Refrigerants* are substances and preparations which, in appliances or systems, transport heat from a lower to a higher temperature.

2 *Ozone-depleting refrigerants* are refrigerants containing substances that deplete the ozone layer (Annex 1.4).

3 *Refrigerants stable in the atmosphere* are refrigerants containing substances stable in the atmosphere (Annex 1.5).

4 A *system* comprises all refrigeration circuits used for one and the same application: it may comprise one or more chillers. The term «chiller» refers to a compact cooling system with one or more refrigeration circuits.

[5] Any non-minor modification of the cooling part of existing systems is deemed to be equivalent to placing systems on the market. Significant modifications of the cooling part of existing systems are not deemed to be equivalent to placing on the market if the modification achieves a significant increase in energy efficiency or, through material savings, avoids significant greenhouse gas emissions.

[6] An appliance is a plug-in cooling system not permanently connected to refrigerant or thermal distribution piping. Fixed appliances are classified as appliances rather than as systems.

[7] *Medium temperature cooling* is the cooling of foodstuffs or perishable goods where the working temperature is not lower than 0 °C or if no freezing occurs.

[8] *Low temperature cooling* is the cooling of foodstuffs or perishable goods where the working temperature is not lower than –25 °C.

[9] *Deep cooling* is the cooling of foodstuffs or perishable goods where the working temperature is lower than –25 °C.

[10] The *cooling capacity* of a system is its effective cooling capacity at peak consumption where the system design corresponds to the state of the art.
