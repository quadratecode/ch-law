ordains:

[**Art. 1** Subject matters](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/930/en#art_1) 

This Ordinance governs the combination in accordance with Article 12 para. 5 OTab of colour photographs or other images with additional warnings on all unit packets of tobacco products and products containing tobacco substitutes designed to be smoked.

[2] Only the combined warnings listed in Annex 1 may be used.

[**Art. 3** Appearance of the combined warning](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/930/en#art_3) 

[1] The image must occupy around 50 % of the surface of the combined warning.

[2] The additional warning must occupy around 38 % of the surface of the combined warning.

[3] Where the image takes the form of a text, it must, together with the additional warning, occupy around 88 % of the surface of the combined warning. 

[4] The “quitline” notice must occupy around 12 % of the surface of the combined warning, not counting the filter of the broken cigarette which overlaps the border.

[5] The additional warning and the colour photograph are linked graphically by a gradient zone going from 100% black to 0% black. This zone must occupy around 10 % of the surface of the combined warning.

[**Art. 4** Layout specifications](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/930/en#art_4) 

[1] The technical specifications for the layout of the combined warnings are listed in Annex 2.

[2] For the remainder, the technical specifications that must be followed are those contained in the following guidelines:

[2] The series is changed once every two years, on 1 January. Packaging units featuring the new series may go on sale in advance, between 1 October and 31 December of the year preceding the change of series.

[3] Packaging units already produced which feature the combined warnings of the previous series may remain on sale as long as stocks last, but not later than 31 December of the year in which the series changed.

[**Art. 6** Use of the images and the “quitline” notice](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/930/en#art_6) 

[1] The images and the “quitline” notice contained in Annex 1 must be used exclusively for the creation of combined warnings.

## [Technical specifications for the layout of combined warnings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/930/en#lvl_d1110e20/lvl_d1110e21)


### [1 General rules](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/930/en#lvl_d1110e20/lvl_d1110e21/lvl_1)

1.1  The combined warnings must be reproduced without any changes to their proportions or colours. 

1.2  They are conceived as a whole image and must not be amended.

1.3  They must be printed in four-colour/-CMYK-/ screen 133 lines per inch as a minimum requirement.

### [2 Special rules arising from the size of the package](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/930/en#lvl_d1110e20/lvl_d1110e21/lvl_2)

Where the size of the package so requires, the combined warnings may be modified according to the following rules.

2.1  For the additional warnings, the font size and line breaks may be modified to ensure that the warnings are easily readable.

2.2  For images which consist of a white text, the font size and line breaks may be modified. The relative surfaces occupied by the image in the form of a white text and the additional warning must be respected.

2.3  For photographs and other coloured images, the graphical editing is carried out as follows:


|    a. by proportionate scaling of the photograph or the coloured image and  
|    b. by varying the relative surfaces occupied by the photograph and by the corresponding text of the additional warning:  
|    1. where the proportion between the height and the width of the combined warning is less than 0.8, the additional warning placed under the image in the combined warnings listed in Annex 1 may be moved to the right of the photograph or other image.  
|    2. where the proportion between the height and the width of the combined warning exceeds 1.2, the additional warning placed to the side of the image in the combined warnings listed in Annex 1 may be moved under the photograph or other image.



2.4  In order to ensure that the “quitline” notice is easily readable, the font size and the line breaks (1, 2 or 4 lines) may be modified. The size of the image of the broken cigarette may be modified by proportionate scaling.
