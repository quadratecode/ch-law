|    ∗ Single pollutants are to be reported if the threshold for BTEX (the sum parameter of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene) is exceeded.  
|    \*\* Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are to be measured as benzo(a)pyrene (50-32-8), benzo(b)fluoranthene (205-99-2),   
benzo(k)fluoranthene (207-08-9), indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene (193-39-5) (derived from the Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants to the   
Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution)

## [Disposal and recovery operations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/33/en#annex_3/lvl_d1176e28)

### [1. Disposal operations (“D”)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/33/en#annex_3/lvl_d1176e28/lvl_1)


|    - Deposit into or onto land (e.g. landfill)  
|    - Land treatment (e.g. biodegredation of liquid or sludgy discards in soils)  
|    - Specially engineered landfill (e.g. placement into lined discrete cells which are capped and isolated from one another and the environment)  
|    - Biological treatment not specified elsewhere in this Annex which results in final compounds or mixtures that are discarded by means of any of the operations specified in this part  
|    - Physico-chemical treatment not specified elsewhere in this Annex which results in final compounds or mixtures that are discarded by means of any of the operations specified in this part (e.g. evaporation, drying, calcination, neutralisation, precipitation)  
|    - Incineration on land  
|    - Permanent storage (e. g. placement of containers in a mine)  
|    - Blending or mixing prior to submission to any of the operations specified in this part  
|    - Repackaging prior to submission to any of the operations specified in this part  
|    - Storage pending any of the operations specified in this part

### [2. Recovery operations (“R”)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2007/33/en#annex_3/lvl_d1176e28/lvl_2)


|    - Use as a fuel (other than in direct incineration) or other means to generate energy  
|    - Solvent reclamation/regeneration   
|    - Recycling/reclamation of organic substances that are not used as solvents   
|    - Recycling/reclamation of metals and metal compounds  
|    - Recycling/reclamation of other inorganic materials  
|    - Regeneration of acids or bases  
|    - Recovery of components used for pollution abatement  
|    - Recovery of components from catalysts  
|    - Used oil re-refining or other reuses of previously used oil  
|    - Land treatment resulting in benefit to agriculture or ecological improvement  
|    - Uses of residual materials obtained from any of the recovery operations specified above in this part  
|    - Exchange of wastes for submission to any of the recovery operations specified above in this part  
|    - Accumulation of material intended for any operation specified in this part
