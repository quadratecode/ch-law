# [Section 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#sec_1)

[**Art. 1** Purpose and scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_1) 

[1] The purpose of this Ordinance is to protect the public and the environment against serious harm or damage resulting from major accidents.

[2] It applies to:


|    a. establishments where the threshold quantities for substances, preparations or special wastes specified in Annex 1.1 are exceeded;  
|    b. establishments where an activity involving genetically modified or pathogenic organisms or alien microorganisms subject to compulsory containment is carried out which is to be assigned to Class 3 or Class 4 in accordance with the Containment Ordinance of 9 May 2012;  
|    c. railway installations in accordance with Annex 1.2*a*;  
|    d. transit roads, as defined in the Ordinance of 6 June 1983 on Transit Roads, where dangerous goods are transported or transhipped in accordance with the Ordinance of 17 April 1985 on the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (SDR) or the relevant international agreements;  
|    e. the Rhine, where dangerous goods are transported or transhipped in accordance with the Ordinance of 29 April 1970 on the Carriage of Dangerous Goods on the Rhine (ADNR);  
|    f. pipeline installations as defined in the Pipelines Ordinance of 26 June 2019 which meet the criteria specified in Annex 1.3.

[2bis] The enforcement authority may exempt establishments under paragraph 2 letter b from the scope of this Ordinance that:


|    a. only carry out Class 3 activities with organisms in accordance with Annex 1.4 which, due to their properties, cannot spread uncontrollably among the public and in the environment; and   
|    b. due to their hazard potential, cannot seriously harm the public or the environment.

[3] In individual cases, the enforcement authority may make the following establishments, transport routes or pipeline installations subject to this Ordinance if, on account of their hazard potential, they could cause serious harm to the public or damage to the environment:


|    a. establishments handling substances, preparations or special wastes;  
|    b. establishments where an activity involving genetically modified or pathogenic organisms or alien microorganisms subject to compulsory containment is carried out which is to be assigned to Class 2 in accordance with the Containment Ordinance, in consultation with the Swiss Expert Committee for Biosafety;  
|    c. transport routes outside establishments, where dangerous goods are transported or transhipped in accordance with paragraph 2;  
|    d. pipeline installations as defined in the Pipelines Ordinance which do not meet the criteria specified in Annex 1.3.

[4] This Ordinance does not apply to installations and forms of transport which are subject to legislation on nuclear energy and radiological protection, insofar as the associated radiation could cause harm to the public or damage to the environment.

[5] The provisions of Article 10 EPA are directly applicable to establishments or transport routes which, in the case of exceptional events, could cause serious harm to the public or damage to the environment not arising from substances, preparations, special wastes or dangerous goods, or from genetically modified or pathogenic organisms or alien organisms subject to compulsory containment.

[**Art. 2** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_2) 

[1] An *establishment* comprises installations as defined in Article 7 paragraph 7 EPA which have closely related operations and are in close proximity to each other (operating area).

[2] *…*

[3] The *hazard potential* is the sum of the effects which could arise from the quantities and properties of the substances, preparations, special wastes, organisms or dangerous goods in question. 

[4] A *major accident* is an exceptional event occurring in an establishment, on a transport route or in a pipeline installation which has significant effects:


|    a. outside the operating area;  
|    b. on or near the transport route;  
|    c. near the pipeline installation.

[5] The *risk* is determined by the extent of the possible harm to the public or damage to the environment resulting from major accidents and the likelihood of their occurrence.

# [Section 2 Principles of Prevention](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#sec_2)

[**Art. 3** Safety measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_3)

[1] The person responsible for an establishment, a transport route or a pipeline installation shall take all appropriate measures to reduce risk that are available in accordance with the state of the art of safety technology, supplemented by personal experience, and which are economically viable. These shall include measures to reduce the hazard potential, to prevent major accidents and to limit the effects thereof.

[2] When measures are selected, account shall be taken of operational and local factors which could cause major accidents, as well as actions of unauthorised persons.

[3] When measures are implemented, account shall be taken in particular of the principles laid down in Annex 2, and in particular the measures in accordance with Annexes 2.2–2.5.

[**Art. 4**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_4)

[**Art. 5** Summary report](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_5) 

[1] The person responsible for an establishment must submit a summary report to the enforcement authority. It shall include:


|    a. a concise description of the establishment, together with a general plan and information on the surrounding area;  
|    b. a list of the maximum quantities of the substances, preparations or special wastes present in the establishment which exceed the threshold quantities specified in Annex 1.1, together with the applicable threshold quantities;  
|    c. the risk report specified in Article 8 of the Containment Ordinance of 9 May 2012;  
|    d. documents drawn up in the preparation of any property and corporate liability insurance policies;  
|    e. details of safety measures;  
|    f. an estimate of the extent of possible harm to the public or damage to the environment resulting from major accidents.

[2] The person responsible for a transport route shall submit a summary report to the enforcement authority. It shall include:


|    a. a concise description of the structural and technical design of the transport route, together with a general plan and information on the surrounding area;  
|    b. data on the volume and structure of traffic on the transport route and accident statistics;  
|    c. details of safety measures;  
|    d. an estimate of the likelihood of a major accident causing serious harm to the public or damage to the environment.

[3] The person responsible for a pipeline installation shall submit a summary report to the enforcement authority. It shall include:


|    a. a concise description of the structural and technical design of the pipeline installation, together with a general plan and information on the surrounding area;  
|    b. data on the type, composition and physical state of the substances and preparations transported, together with the approved operating pressure and accident statistics;  
|    c. details of safety measures;  
|    d. an estimate of the likelihood of a major accident causing serious harm to the public or damage to the environment.

[4] …

[5] The enforcement authority shall exempt the person responsible for a through road from the duty to submit a summary report if, based on the information available, it is able, without a summary report, to assess as valid the assumption that the likelihood of major accidents causing serious harm is sufficiently low.

[**Art. 6** Assessment of the summary report, risk report](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_6) 

[1] The enforcement authority shall verify that the summary report is complete and correct.

[2] In particular, it shall verify:


|    a. in the case of establishments, whether the estimate of the extent of possible harm or damage (Art. 5 para. 1 let. f) is plausible;  
|    b. in the case of transport routes, whether the estimate of the likelihood of a major accident causing serious harm or damage (Art. 5 para. 2 let. d) is plausible;  
|    c. in the case of pipeline installations, whether the estimate of the likelihood of a major accident causing serious harm or damage (Art. 5 para. 3 let. d) is plausible.

[3] Following an on-site inspection, where appropriate, it shall assess the validity of the assumption that:


|    a. in the case of establishments, serious harm to the public or damage to the environment arising from major accidents is not to be expected;  
|    b. in the case of transport routes, the likelihood of occurrence of a major accident causing serious harm or damage is sufficiently low;  
|    c. in the case of pipeline installations, the likelihood of occurrence of a major accident causing serious harm or damage is sufficiently low.

[3bis] The enforcement authority shall set out the results of its assessment in writing.

[4] If the assumption in accordance with paragraph 3 is not valid, it shall order the person responsible to prepare and submit to it a risk report in accordance with Annex 4.

[**Art. 7** Assessment of the risk report](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_7) 

[1] The enforcement authority shall review the risk report and assess whether the risk is acceptable. It shall set out its assessment in writing.

[2] When evaluating the acceptability of the risk, it shall take account of local risk factors and pay particular attention to the fact that the likelihood of occurrence of a major accident must be all the lower:


|    a. the more the need to protect the public or the environment against serious harm or damage arising from major accidents outweighs private and public interests in the operation of an establishment, a transport route or a pipeline installation;  
|    b. the greater the extent of the possible harm to the public or damage to the environment.

[**Art. 8** Additional safety measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_8) 

[1] If the risk is unacceptable, the enforcement authority shall order such additional measures as may be required. If necessary, these may include restrictions or prohibitions on operations and traffic.

[2] In the case of measures for which a different public body is responsible, the enforcement authority shall submit appropriate requests to the competent authority. If necessary, the Federal Council shall coordinate the adoption of measures.

[**Art. 8***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_8_a) [Change in circumstances](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_8_a) 

[1] If the person responsible has prepared a summary report, but not a risk report and if the circumstances change significantly thereafter or relevant new findings become available, they must amend the summary report and resubmit it to the enforcement authority.

[2] If the person responsible has prepared a risk report and the circumstances change significantly thereafter or relevant new findings become available, they must: 


|    a. amend the risk report and resubmit it to the enforcement authority;  
|    b. amend the summary report instead of the risk report and resubmit it to the enforcement authority if:  
|    1. serious harm to the public or to the environment from major accidents need no longer be expected,  
|    2. in the case of transport routes and pipeline installations, the probability of a major accident causing serious harm is sufficiently low.



[**Art. 8***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_8_b) [Inspections](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1991/748_748_748/en#art_8_b) 

[1] In order to verify if the person responsible is fulfilling their duties under this Ordinance, the enforcement authority shall conduct regular on-site inspections. It shall set out its assessment in writing.

[2] The enforcement authority shall decide on the frequency of inspection based on the hazard potential, the type and complexity of the establishment, transport route or pipeline installation and the results of earlier inspections.
