# [Annex 1](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#annex_1)

(Art. 3 let. d)

## [Definition of Gene Technology Methods](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#annex_1/lvl_d1358e59)

[1] Gene technology methods means, in particular:


|    a. recombinant nucleic acid techniques, in which nucleic acid molecules synthesised outside an organism are inserted into viruses, bacterial plasmids or other vector systems to produce novel combinations of genetic material, which are then transferred to a recipient organism in which they do not naturally occur but are capable of continued propagation;  
|    b. techniques in which genetic material produced outside the organism is inserted directly into an organism, in particular by microinjection, macroinjection and microencapsulation, electroporation or on microprojectiles;  
|    c. cell fusion or hybridisation techniques in which cells with novel combinations of genetic material are produced by the fusion of two or more cells through processes that do not occur under natural conditions.

[2] Self-cloning of pathogenic organisms is regarded as a gene technology method. This consists of the removal of nucleic acid sequences from one cell of an organism and the complete or partial insertion of this nucleic acid or a synthetic equivalent (possibly after a previous enzymatic or mechanical treatment) into cells of the same species or cells which are closely related phylogenetically and which can exchange genetic material by natural physiological processes.

[3] Self-cloning of non-pathogenic organisms and the following methods are not regarded as gene technology methods as long as they are not used in association with recombinant nucleic acid molecules or genetically modified organisms:


|    a. mutagenesis;  
|    b. cell and protoplast fusion of prokaryotic microorganisms that exchange genetic material by natural physiological processes;  
|    c. cell and protoplast fusion of eukaryotic cells, including the production of hybridoma cell lines and the fusion of plant cells;  
|    d. in vitro fertilisation;  
|    e. natural processes such as conjugation, transduction and transformation;  
|    f. changes in ploidy level, including aneuploidy and the elimination of chromosomes.

## [Assigning organisms to groups](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#lvl_d1358e63/lvl_d1358e64)

### [1 Risk determination](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#lvl_d1358e63/lvl_d1358e64/lvl_1)

[1] In order to determine the risk due to the occurrence of an organism for human beings, animals or the environment as well as biological diversity and its sustainable use, the following criteria in particular must be taken into account:


|    a. pathogenicity and lethality;  
|    b. virulence or attenuation;  
|    c. mode of infection, effective infection dose and the infection routes;  
|    d. production of non-cellular components such as toxins and allergens;  
|    e. the reproductive cycle and survival structures;  
|    f. host range;  
|    g. the degree of natural or acquired immunity of the host;  
|    h. pattern of resistance or sensitivity to antibiotics and other specific agents;  
|    i. availability of appropriate prophylaxis and therapy;  
|    j. the presence of oncogenic nucleic acid sequences;  
|    k. mutagenicity;  
|    l. virus production and viral shedding in cell lines;  
|    m. parasitic properties;  
|    n. potential contamination with pathogenic microorganisms;  
|    o. environmental aspects;  
|    p. experience with the spread of closely related types of organism in Switzerland or in other countries (invasive potential);  
|    q. the availability of suitable techniques to record, detect, identify, monitor and combat these organisms;  
|    r. potential for improper use.

[2] In order to determine the risk arising when a genetically modified organism occurs, both donor and receptor organisms, introduced genetic material (inserts), the vector or the vector-receptor system and the genetically modified organism itself must be taken into account, in particular according to the following criteria:


|    a. function of the genetic changes;  
|    b. degree of purity and characterisation of the genetic material used in recombination;  
|    c. properties of vectors, in particular relating to replication capacity, host range, host specificity, existence of a transfer system, mobilisation and independent infectivity;  
|    d. properties of affected nucleic acid sequences, in particular regulatory effects on cell growth, cell cycle and immune system;  
|    e. production and supply of organisms and active pharmaceutical substances, allergens or toxins via the genetically modified organism;  
|    f. stability and expression of recombinant genetic material;  
|    g. mobilisation potential of recombinant genetic material;  
|    h. selection pressure for recombinant genetic material.

[3] In order to determine the risk due to the occurrence of an alien organism for human beings, animals or the environment as well as biological diversity and its sustainable use, the following criteria in particular must be taken into account:


|    a. life cycle and reproduction, in particular with regard to asexual reproduction, generation time and the number of offspring;  
|    b. presence of host organisms in the environment;  
|    c. environmental aspects and viability, in particular cold tolerance and diapause;  
|    d. potential contamination with microorganisms that may be pathogenic for humans, animals and plants;  
|    e. invasiveness and ability to suppress native species;  
|    f. threat to human, animal and plant health by the organism due to its allergicity, pathogenicity, toxicity or property as a vector;  
|    g. harm to other organisms, in particular through competition and hybridisation;  
|    h. harm to resource cycles;  
|    i. effects on the functioning of the ecosystem;  
|    j. resistance or sensitivity to pesticides, herbicides and other agents;  
|    k. availability of suitable techniques to detect the organism in the environment and to combat it.

### [2 Risk assessment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#lvl_d1358e63/lvl_d1358e64/lvl_2)

[1] When making a risk assessment, the effects of the organisms on healthy people, animals and plants must generally be considered.

[2] The risk is considered inexistent or negligible (Group 1) if:


|    a. it is unlikely that an organism will cause illness in people, animals or plants or some other damage to the environment or to biological diversity and its sustainable use; and  
|    b. such damage is not severe.

[3] The risk is considered low (Group 2) if:


|    a. an organism may cause illness in people, animals or plants or some other damage to the environment or to biological diversity and its sustainable use;  
|    b. such illness or damage is rarely severe;  
|    c. the organism is unlikely to spread; and  
|    d. normally effective preventive or therapeutic measures to combat the illness or damage are available.

[4] The risk is considered moderate (Group 3), if:


|    a. an organism may cause severe illness in people, animals or plants or other severe damage to the environment or to biological diversity and its sustainable use;  
|    b. the organism is likely to spread; and  
|    c. normally, effective preventive or therapeutic measures to combat the illness or damage are available.

[5] The risk is considered high (Group 4), if:


|    a. an organism may cause severe illness in people, animals or plants or other severe damage to the environment or to biological diversity and its sustainable use;  
|    b. the organism is likely to spread; and  
|    c. normally, no effective preventive or therapeutic measures to combat the illness or damage are available.

[6] If, in an individual case, it is unclear to which of two groups an organism belongs, the risk must be assessed by weighing the seriousness of the illness and damage, and the probability that the organism will spread, against the availability of effective preventive or therapeutic measures. In the event of any doubt, an organism must be assigned to the higher of two groups.

# [Annex 2.2](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#lvl_d1358e67)

(Art. 7)

## [Classification of activities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#lvl_d1358e67/lvl_d1358e68)

### [1 Risk determination](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#lvl_d1358e67/lvl_d1358e68/lvl_1)

In order to determine the risk arising from planned activities with organisms in a contained system, the following criteria in particular should be taken into account while considering the group to which the organisms concerned have been assigned:


|    a. the nature, extent and purpose of the activity, such as diagnosis, research, production or storage;  
|    b. the known or suspected geographical distribution and frequency in Switzerland of the organisms concerned or of their hosts and vectors and if applicable of the recombinant genetic material involved endemically, by natural occurrence, immigration, reproduction or genetic transfer;  
|    c. the potential for survival, replication and dissemination of the organisms in Switzerland, in particular the formation of long-lasting forms;  
|    d. the interaction of the organisms concerned with other organisms or involvement in biogeochemical processes;  
|    e. host or vector occurrence in Switzerland;  
|    f. the impact of the activity on pathogenicity, detectability and transmissibility, ability to survive and disseminate, virulence, host spectrum or tropism of the organisms used;  
|    g. the influence of the activity on the effectiveness of vaccines, antibiotics, antivirals or other agents with a medical or agricultural use against pathogenic organisms;  
|    h. the purpose of the activity in producing novel pathogenic organisms or restoring extinct or extinct pathogenic organisms;  
|    i. the potential of the pathogenic organisms for improper use.

### [2 Risk assessment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#lvl_d1358e67/lvl_d1358e68/lvl_2)

#### [2.1 In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#lvl_d1358e67/lvl_d1358e68/lvl_2/lvl_d1358e71)

[1] The class of an activity normally corresponds to the group to which the organisms have been assigned. However, the class differs from the group of organisms if the risk assessment indicates, based on the activity and environmental conditions, a considerably increased or reduced risk compared with the group to which the organisms have been assigned.

[2] An activity is assigned to Class 1 if it presents no risk or a negligible risk to people, animals, the environment and biological diversity and its sustainable use, in particular if no impact or a negligible impact on these targets can be expected should organisms escape from the contained system.

[3] An activity is assigned to Class 2 if it presents a low risk to people, animals, the environment and biological diversity and its sustainable use, in particular if a limited, reversible impact on these targets can be expected should organisms escape from the contained system.

[4] An activity is assigned to Class 3 if it presents a moderate risk to people, animals, the environment and biological diversity and its sustainable use, in particular if an irreversible but limited impact on these targets can be expected should organisms escape from the contained system.

[5] An activity is assigned to Class 4 if it presents a high risk to people, animals, the environment and biological diversity and its sustainable use, in particular if an irreversible impact on these targets can be expected or epidemics with serious consequences may possibly occur should organisms escape from the contained system.

[6] If, in an individual case, it is unclear to which of two classes an organism belongs, it must be assigned to the higher of two classes.

#### [2.2 In particular](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#lvl_d1358e67/lvl_d1358e68/lvl_2/lvl_d1358e72)

[1] The following activities are normally assigned to Class 1:


|    a. analyses of soil, water, air or food samples, provided it can be assumed that the samples are not so contaminated that they pose an increased risk to human beings, animals, the environment and biological diversity and its sustainable use;  
|    b. analyses of organisms in Groups 1 and 2 from clinical and other biological material for diagnostic purposes, if organisms can be shown to be present by direct or indirect methods without propagation, or if organisms can be shown to be present following slight enrichment carried out exclusively in closed containers;  
|    c. activities with certain strains of Group 2 organisms, provided such strains have proved in experiments or over many years of experience to be as safe as Group 1 organisms.

[2] Analyses of organisms from clinical and other biological material for diagnostic purposes with exception of analyses under paragraph 1 must normally be assigned to Class 2. 

[3] Where Group 3 pathogenic organisms have been enriched for diagnostic purposes and if this results in an increased risk to human beings, animals or the environment as well as biological diversity and its sustainable use, this activity must be assigned to Class 3.

[4] When Group 4 organisms are processed, the activity should in most cases be assigned to Class 4. However, if a primary diagnostics of Group 4 organisms from non-inactivated clinical material is performed by direct or indirect methods without replication, this activity may be assigned to Class 3. Where further testing is carried out using the same source material containing Group 4 organisms, this activity must in all cases be assigned to Class 4.

[5] Primary diagnosis of Group 3 organisms that are pathogenic to animals may in exceptional cases and in accordance with Article 49 para. 2 EzDO be assigned to Class 2 if it can be assumed that there is a high probability that no pathogen organisms are present in the samples.

### [1 General safety measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#annex_4/lvl_d1358e84/lvl_1)

The following safety measures apply to all species and classes of activity:


|    a. Compliance with the generally recognised codes of building practice in the construction and maintenance of buildings and installations, in particular with a view to their stability, the safety of persons and property and fire prevention;  
|    b. Compliance with the operational safety concept and the related operating instructions and codes of conduct;  
|    c. Employment of at least one person to monitor biological safety and prevent the improper use of organisms; the person must have sufficient knowledge of and competence in both technical matters and safety issues to carry out his or her duties; the tasks include in particular preparing, updating and implementing the safety concept, informing, advising and training staff, verifying compliance with biosafety rules and communicating with the authorities in relation to notifications, authorisation applications, safety measures and the safety concept;  
|    d. Employment of a sufficient number of staff adequately trained on security issues;  
|    e. Compliance with the principles of good microbiological practice in accordance with Annex 3 number 1 paragraph 1 of the Ordinance of 25 August 1999 on the Protection of Employees from Dangerous Organisms, including the provision of washing and decontamination facilities for the staff;  
|    f. Appropriate inspections and maintenance of the monitoring measures and the equipment;  
|    g. If required, testing for the occurrence of viable forms of the organisms used outside the primary physical barriers;  
|    h. Use of suitable storage facilities for equipment and materials that could be contaminated;  
|    i. Provision of effective decontaminants and disinfectants and procedures in case of a release of organisms;  
|    j. Measures against any pests and vermin;  
|    k. Appropriate measures to minimise any previously identified risk of improper use of the organisms, such as restricting access to premises and recording the identity of persons with access to the organisms used.

Depending on the nature and class of the activity, special safety measures that go beyond the general safety measures must be taken which:


|    a. must take account of the risk determined in the specific case;  
|    b. must correspond to the state of the art in safety technology;  
|    b[bis]. take account of the possibility of improper use of organisms;   
|    c. are listed according to the safety levels in specific installations in the following table, whereby the information under Safety Levels 1–4 corresponds to the requirements for the conduct of activities in Classes 1–4;  
|    d. apply mutatis mutandis to the storage and the transport within the installation of organisms.

#### [2.2 Activities with alien organisms subject to a containment obligation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2012/329/en#annex_4/lvl_d1358e84/lvl_2/lvl_d1358e89)

[1] For activities with alien organisms subject to a containment obligation, all potential escape paths must be secured by appropriate special safety measures so as to ensure that any escape of alien organisms subject to a containment obligation:


|    a. is so limited in the case of Class 1 and 2 activities that human beings, animals and the environment cannot be endangered and biological diversity and its sustainable use cannot be harmed;  
|    b. is prevented in the case of Class 3 and 4 activities.

[2] The special safety measures in Annex 4 number 2.1 apply mutatis mutandis.
