(Art. 3 letter d)

## [Definition of Gene Technology Methods](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/614/en#annex_1/lvl_d1521e93)

[1] Gene technology methods means, in particular:


|    a. recombinant nucleic acid techniques, in which nucleic acid molecules synthesised outside the organism are inserted into viruses, bacterial plasmids or other vector systems to produce novel combinations of genetic material, which are then transferred to a recipient (host) organism in which they would not naturally occur but are capable of continued propagation;  
|    b. techniques in which genetic material produced outside the organism is inserted directly into an organism, in particular by microinjection, macroinjection and microencapsulation, electroporation or on microprojectiles;  
|    c. cell fusion or hybridisation techniques in which cells with novel combinations of genetic material are produced by the fusion of two or more cells through processes that do not occur under natural conditions.

[2] Self-cloning of pathogenic organisms shall be regarded as a method of gene technology. This consists of the removal of nucleic acid sequences from one cell of an organism and the complete or partial insertion of this nucleic acid or a synthetic equivalent (possibly after a previous enzymatic or mechanical treatment) into cells of the same species or cells which are closely related phylogenetically and which can exchange genetic material by natural physiological processes.

[3] Self-cloning of non-pathogenic organisms and the following methods shall not be regarded as methods of gene technology, as long as they are not used in association with recombinant nucleic acid molecules or genetically modified organisms:


|    a. mutagenesis;  
|    b. cell and protoplast fusion of prokaryotic microorganisms that exchange genetic material by natural physiological processes;  
|    c. cell and protoplast fusion of eukaryotic cells, including the production of hybridoma cell lines and the fusion of plant cells;  
|    d. in vitro fertilisation;  
|    e. natural processes such as conjugation, transduction and transformation;  
|    f. changes in ploidy level, including aneuploidy and the elimination of chromosomes.

(Art. 19, 20, 21, 28, 29 and 30)

## [Determination and Assessment of Risk](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/614/en#annex_4/lvl_d1521e132)

### [1 Purpose and procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/614/en#annex_4/lvl_d1521e132/lvl_1)

[1] The purpose of determining the risk is to determine and assess the consequences of the real case of handling organisms in the environment, for:

human beings, animals or the environment and biological diversity and the sustainable use thereof;

in the case of genetically modified organisms, the long-term preservation of production that does not use genetically modified organisms.

[2] The risk assessment must evaluate the justifiability of the risk.

[3] The determination of risk must be carried out in accordance with scientific criteria and methods and be based on available scientific and technical data, scientific publications, results of calculations and detailed analyses. The evaluation of the risks for their justifiability must be presented in a grounded and understandable way.

### [2 Identification of hazards and determination of risk](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/614/en#annex_4/lvl_d1521e132/lvl_2)

#### [2.1 Identification of hazards](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/614/en#annex_4/lvl_d1521e132/lvl_2/lvl_d1521e136)

1 The potential of organisms, when handled in the environment, to impair the two protection targets given under Number 1 paragraph 1 shall be determined. In particular, the following must be taken into consideration:


|    a. the properties of the organisms;  
|    b. experience in using the organisms;  
|    c. the genetic modifications in the case of genetically modified organisms;  
|    d. the interactions with the environment;  
|    e. the customary transport and processing paths for these organisms.

[2] This determination shall be based on details in accordance with Articles 19, 20 or 21, or 28, 29 or 30.

#### [2.2 Determination of risk](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/614/en#annex_4/lvl_d1521e132/lvl_2/lvl_d1521e137)

[1] The risk is determined by the extent of the possible damage to the protection targets given under Number 1 paragraph 1 and the probability that this damage will occur.

[2] To protect human beings, animals and the environment, as well as biological diversity and the sustainable use thereof, the following damage scenarios, at least, must be examined:


|    *Endangerment to human health caused by the organisms or their gene pro**d**ucts*: the type (allergenicity, pathogenicity, toxicity etc.) and the severity of possible effects must be indicated;   
|    *Establishment and spread of the organisms*: the paths of escape from the site of use, the conditions for establishment in the environment, the development of population density, the extent of displacement of other organisms (single individuals, whole populations, whole species) and the species affected (cultivated or wild organisms, endangered or useful species) must be indicated;   
|    c. *Gene transfer:* the paths for a transmission of genetic material, the mechanisms of crossing out or recombination and the possible crossing partners, the fertility of the offspring and their selective advantages must be indicated;  
|    d. *Impairment of other organisms (non-target organisms):* the type of direct effects (e.g. through toxic gene products) or indirect effects (e.g. through an alteration of soil cultivation) and the duration (acute, chronic) and severity of the effects must be indicated;  
|    e. *Endangerment of material cycles*: the type of alteration of pollutants and nutrients in the soil or in water and the degree of the alteration must be indicated and must be evaluated in terms of the disturbance of important ecosystem functions (nitrogen fixation, soil respiration etc.);  
|    f. *Development of resistance*: the type of resistance developed, the consequences for control strategies and the ecological impacts of alternative control strategies must be indicated.  
|    [3] In the case of genetically modified organisms, to protect production that does not use genetically modified organisms the following damage scenarios, at least, must be examined:   
|    *Contamination of production areas through vertical gene transfer:* gene transfer through sexual recombination (e.g. crossing-out mechanisms, pollen flight distances, possible crossing partners within the species cultivated or used, fertility of offspring and their selective advantages) must be indicated;   
|    *Contamination of products without genetically modified organisms through the use of equipment:* the use of equipment to release and process the organisms (e.g. sowing or harvesting machines), customary usage (e.g. one’s own machines and those borrowed from cooperatives), as well as cleaning procedures must be indicated;   
|    *Contamination of products without genetically modified organisms through unintentional losses:* possible escape paths (e.g. second growth, drift of plant protection products, losses in transport), as well as the establishment and spread of the organisms (e.g. conditions for establishment in the environment, development of population density) must be indicated;   
|    *Contamination of products without genetically modified organisms in processing:* the usual processing paths, steps and locations at which mixtures and ambiguities could occur must be indicated.   
|    [4] The probability that damage could occur during handling in the environment must be determined for all damage scenarios. 

[5] The information must be quantified as far as possible.

### [3 Risk assessment and risk management](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/614/en#annex_4/lvl_d1521e132/lvl_3)

#### [3.1 Evaluation of safety measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/614/en#annex_4/lvl_d1521e132/lvl_3/lvl_d1521e139)

[1] On the basis of the risk determination, the possible safety measures must be determined; their efficacy in terms of reducing the risk should be evaluated.

[2] If several equivalent safety measures are available, the choice of the proposed measure must be justified.

#### [3.2 Assessment of risk](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/614/en#annex_4/lvl_d1521e132/lvl_3/lvl_d1521e140)

[1] The risk of the planned handling in the environment shall be examined for its justifiability, on the basis of the type, severity and probability of possible damage, and taking account of the planned safety measures.

[2] Reasons must be presented as to why the risk determined in Number 2 is justifiable for the protection targets given in section 1 paragraph 1.

[3] When assessing justifiability, the following should be considered:

the precautionary principle in accordance with Article 2 GTA and Article 1 paragraph 2 EPA;

the effectiveness of the safety measures determined in accordance with Number 3.1;

other risks within the meaning of Article 6 paragraph 4 GTA and Article 8 EPA;

whether damage could be reversed;

that the greater the extent of possible damage, the smaller the probability of its occurrence must be.
