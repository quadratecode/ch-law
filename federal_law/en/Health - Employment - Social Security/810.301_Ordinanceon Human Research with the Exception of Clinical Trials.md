[**Art. 6** Research project](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/642/en#art_6) 

For the purposes of this Chapter, a research project is any project in which biological material is sampled or health-related personal data is collected from a person in order to:


|    a. answer a scientific question; or  
|    b. make further use for research purposes of the biological material or the health-related personal data.

[**Art. 7** Categorisation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/642/en#art_7) 

[1] A research project comes under Category A if the planned measures for sampling biological material or collecting personal data entail only minimal risks and burdens.

[2] A research project comes under Category B if the planned measures entail more than only minimal risks and burdens.

[3] Sampling biological material or collecting health-related personal data entails minimal risks and burdens if the measures, in terms of intensity and quality, and taking into account the vulnerability of the participants and the specific circumstances, have only a slight and temporary impact on the participants’ health. In particular, minimal risks and burdens may be associated with:


|    a. surveys and observations;  
|    b. peripheral venous or capillary blood sampling and skin punch biopsies of limited extent;  
|    c. removing or collecting bodily substances without invasive interventions (in particular, saliva, urine and stool samples);  
|    d. taking swabs;  
|    e. magnetic resonance imaging scans without a contrast medium, ultrasound examinations or electrograms;  
|    f. examinations using medical devices in accordance with Article 3 of the Medical Devices Ordinance of 1 July 2020 that bear a conformity marking and are used without a contrast medium, and examinations using authorised medicinal products capable of emitting ionising radiation, provided that the effective dose is below 5 mSv per research project and per participant.

[**Art. 8** Information](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/642/en#art_8)

|    c. the consequences of revoking consent to further use of the biological material and personal data collected up to this point;  
|    d. their right to receive information at any time in response to further questions;  
|    e. their right to be informed of results concerning their health, and their right to forgo such information or to designate a person who is to take this decision for them;  
|    f. the measures envisaged to cover any damage arising from the research project, including the procedure in the event of a claim;  
|    g. the main sources of financing for the research project;  
|    h. other points relevant to their decision on participation.

[2] If the intention exists to make further use for research of the biological material sampled or the health-related personal data collected, the persons concerned must also receive information on the points specified in Articles 28−32.

[3] The information may be provided in stages. It may be additionally presented in a non-textual form.

[4] Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that the persons concerned have understood the essential elements of the information provided.

[**Art. 9** Exceptions to written form](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/642/en#art_9)

|    a. the person concerned, for physical or cognitive reasons, cannot read or cannot write; and  
|    b. the project leader furnishes proof of the provision of information and consent, specifically by means of written confirmation by witnesses, or by a recording of verbal consent.

[3] In individual cases, the requirement to provide information in written form may be waived if:


|    a. this could only be implemented with disproportionate effort, given the language skills of the person concerned; and  
|    b. an independent qualified translator is called in to provide oral information and gives written confirmation thereof.

[**Art. 10** Consequences of revocation of consent](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2013/642/en#art_10) 

[1] If consent is revoked, the biological material and health‑related personal data of the person concerned must be anonymised after data evaluation has been completed.

[2] Anonymisation of the biological material and personal data may be dispensed with if:


|    a. the person concerned expressly renounces this right when revoking consent; or  
|    b. it is established at the beginning of the research project that anonymisation is not possible and the person concerned, having been adequately informed of this fact, consented to participate.

[3] Persons revoking consent must be offered any follow-up care required to protect their health.
