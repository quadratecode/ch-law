[**Art. 1** Aim and subject matter](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2261_2261_2261/en#art_1) 

[1] This Ordinance is intended to ensure that polluted sites are remediated if they cause harmful effects or nuisances, or if there is a real danger that such effects may arise.

[2] It regulates the following procedures for treating polluted sites:


|    a. their recording in a register;  
|    b. the assessment of the need for monitoring and remediation;  
|    c. the assessment of the objectives and urgency of remediation;  
|    d. the specification of the measures for investigation, monitoring and remediation.

[**Art. 2** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2261_2261_2261/en#art_2) 

[1] *Polluted sites* means sites whose pollution originates from waste, and that are restricted in area. They comprise:


|    a. waste disposal sites, i.e. inoperative or operative landfills and other sites where waste has been deposited, except for sites at which only unpolluted excavation material, quarried material or spoil have been deposited;  
|    b. industrial sites, i.e. sites whose pollution originates from inoperative or operative installations or industrial operations in which environmentally hazardous substances have been used;  
|    c. accident sites, i.e. sites polluted as a result of extraordinary events, including industrial accidents.

[2] *Sites* *in need of* *remediation* are polluted sites that cause harmful effects or nuisances or where there is a real danger that such effects may arise.

[3] *Contaminated sites* are polluted sites in need of remediation.

[**Art. 3** Construction and alteration of buildings and installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2261_2261_2261/en#art_3) 

Polluted sites may be modified by the construction or alteration of buildings and installations only if:


|    a. they are not in need of remediation and the project does not make their remediation necessary; or  
|    b. their later remediation is not seriously hampered, or, insofar as they are modified by the project, they are remediated at the same time.

[**Art. 4** General requirements for measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2261_2261_2261/en#art_4) 

Investigation, monitoring and remediation measures under this Ordinance must correspond to the state of the art and be documented by those responsible.

The Register (Art. 5) shall be prepared by 31 December 2003.

[**Art. 28** Commencement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2261_2261_2261/en#art_28) 

This Ordinance comes into force on 1 October 1998.

# [Annex 1](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2261_2261_2261/en#annex_1)

(Art. 9 and 10)

## [Concentration values for assessing the impact of polluted sites on ground and surface waters](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2261_2261_2261/en#annex_1/lvl_d1294e44)

[1] In assessing the impact of polluted sites on waters, the concentration values in the following table apply. Where no concentration values are given in the table for potential water pollutants which are polluting a site, the authority shall specify a value on a case by case basis with the consent of the FOEN and according to the provisions of the legislation on waters protection.

[2] Where the assessment is based on the eluate of the material of the site, the following requirements apply to sampling, preparation of the eluates and their analysis:


|    a. The number of samples and sampling points shall be chosen such that the samples are representative of the pollution of the site.  
|    b. The eluate shall be prepared on the basis of a test column. The elution liquid used shall be oxygen-free deionised water. This must normally flow upwards through the column at a defined rate. Prior to analysis, the eluate may normally neither be centrifuged nor filtered in a microfilter.  
|    c. The eluate need only be analysed in respect of those substances that are expected to occur at the site based on the historical investigation. In cases where lumped parameters only are analysed, the lowest concentration value of the individual substances shall be taken as the assessment criterion.

[3] For sites with particularly heterogeneous pollution (e.g. waste disposal sites), if samples can be obtained from the seepage water, these may be regarded as equivalent to an eluate.

[4] In assessing the impact of volatile substances, the seepage water shall be regarded as equivalent to an eluate. If it is not possible to take samples of the seepage water, pollutant concentrations shall be calculated based on measurements of interstitial airconcentration.

[5] An eluate test in accordance with paragraph 2 may be dispensed with if the pollutant concentration in the eluate of the material is assessable (i.e. to be above or below the concentration values) on the basis of other information, for example composition and origin of the material at the site, lumped parameters or ecotoxicological investigations, or can be calculated from total content.

[6] The Federal Office shall issue guidelines on sampling, preparation of eluates and their analysis, and on assessment of the impact of volatile substances.

(Art. 11)

## [Concentration values for the assessment of interstitial air at polluted sites](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2261_2261_2261/en#annex_2/lvl_d1294e46)

[1] In assessing the interstitial air of polluted sites, the concentration values in the following table apply. Where no concentration values are given in the table for emissions occurring at the site, e.g. odours or particles, the site is deemed to be in need of remediation if the emissions may lead to excessive ambient concentrations in accordance with the Ordinance of 16 December 1985 on Air Pollution Control.

[2] For sampling and the performance of interstitial air analyses, the following apply:


|    a. Samples must be taken using ground gas detectors at a number of points representative of the pollution of the site. It shall be ensured that no extraneous air is included in the samples.  
|    b. The interstitial air need only be analysed in respect of those constituents that are expected to occur at the site based on the historical investigation. If the analysis is confined to lumped parameters, the lowest concentration value of the individual substances shall be taken as the assessment criterion.

[3] Interstitial air samples may be dispensed with if it can be demonstrated by other means that the concentration values in the interstitial air cannot be exceeded, i.e. based on precise information concerning the composition and origin of the material at the site.

[4] The Federal Agency shall issue guidelines on sampling and on procedures for interstitial air analyses.
