[1] The holders of landfills must pay a charge on the deposit of waste in a landfill in Switzerland.

[2] Any person who exports waste for deposit in a landfill must pay a charge. The obligation to pay the charge also applies to waste that is deposited in a landfill abroad following its export for recovery or treatment.

|    [3] … 

[**Art. 3** Charge rates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/670/en#art_3)

The charge shall become due at the time of deposit in a landfill in Switzerland or at the time of export.

[**Art. 5** Charge declaration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/670/en#art_5) 

[1] Persons required to pay the charge must by the 28 February of each year submit a charge declaration to the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) in respect of the charge due for the previous calendar year.

[2] The declaration must contain all the information required to determine the amount of the charge due. It shall be made on an official form; the FOEN may permit other forms. Holders of landfills must send the canton a copy of the declaration.

[5] In the case of a delayed or incomplete declaration, default interest of 3.5 per cent per annum is payable on the amount of the charge due.

[1] The FOEN shall determine the amount of the charge in a ruling.

[2] If the person required to pay the charge, despite being sent a reminder, fails to submit their charge declaration to the FOEN or if the information required to determine the amount of the charge cannot be ascertained due to a lack of reliable documentation, the FOEN shall make the charge assessment according to its own best judgement.

[3] In doing so, the FOEN may base its assessment on the results of its own checks, information from the canton and historical figures.

[**Art. 6***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/670/en#art_6_a) [Period allowed for payment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/670/en#art_6_a)

[**Art. 7** Additional claim](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/670/en#art_7) 

If the FOEN has erroneously assessed the charge at an amount that is too low, it shall claim the shortfall within two years of issuing its ruling.

[**Art. 8** Limitation period](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2008/670/en#art_8) 

[1] The right to claim the charge is limited to ten years from the end of the calendar year in which it arises.

[2] The limitation period shall be interrupted and begin to run again:


|    a. if the person required to pay the charge acknowledges the right to claim the charge;  
|    b. following any official act by which the right to claim the charge is asserted against the person required to pay the charge.

[3] The right to claim the charge is in every case limited to 15 years from the end of the calendar year in which it arises.
