[1] The FOITT shall operate an information system for generating, transmitting and revoking COVID-19 certificates.

[2] The personal data of requesting persons may not be retained for longer than is necessary for generating, signing and transmitting the certificate, or for revoking it.

[3] In order to detect and prevent misuse and for the purpose of any subsequent revocation of certificates, the system shall log which issuer retrieved which certificates and when.

[1] The FOITT shall operate a system that can be used to submit requests under Article 7 paragraph 1 letter b and by issuers to process these requests.

[2] The system shall allocate the requests as follows:


|    a. requests for the issuance of a certificate to a person resident or with place of origin in Switzerland: to the canton of residence or in the case of Swiss citizens living abroad, to the last canton of residence, or, if the person has never been resident in Switzerland, the canton in which the place of origin is located;  
|    b. requests for the issuance of a certificate to a person who does not fall under letter a: to the canton in which the person spends or plans to spend their first night in Switzerland. 

[3] The Confederation shall charge the issuer in advance a fee of 30 francs for processing a request for the issuance of a certificate to a person pursuant to paragraph 2 letter b. It shall pass on the revenues from this fee to the canton at the end of each quarter. Requests for which no fee has been paid may be declined. The provisions of the General Fees Ordinance of 8 September 2004 also apply.

[4] The requests, the documents submitted and the unique certificate identifier shall be retained for 30 days and then deleted from the system.

[**Art. 27** System for retrieving revoked certificates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2021/325/en#art_27) 

[1] The FOITT shall operate a system that is used to retrieve revoked certificates and contains the unique certificate identifier for this purpose.

[2] The list of revoked certificate identifiers shall be made available to apps used for checking and storing COVID-19 certificates.

[**Art. 28** Storage app: General](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2021/325/en#art_28)

[1] The FOITT shall provide software that the holders of COVID-19 certificates can install on their mobile telephones or similar devices and use for the secure transmission and electronic storage of the certificates.

[2] The following principles apply to the software:


|    a. It may disclose the contents of certificates or make statements about it solely with the holder's consent in the individual case.  
|    b. The contents of certificates must be protected against unauthorised access by means of appropriate measures.  
|    c. The FOITT shall publish the source code and technical specifications for the software it makes available.

[1] The app for storing COVID-19 certificates shall enable holders to obtain a certificate with data minimisation for use in Switzerland.

[2] To do so, the holder uses the app to send a COVID-19 certificate to the system for issuing COVID-19 certificates. If the certificate sent is valid, the system generates the data-minimised certificate and send it to the storage app.

[3] The certificate with data minimisation contains:


|    a. the general content in accordance with Article 12 letter a and Annex 1 section 1;   
|    b. the designation of Swiss COVID-19 certificate with data minimisation;  
|    c. the expiry date.

[4] The period of validity of the certificate with data minimisation shall correspond to the shortest period of validity of COVID-19 test certificates in accordance with Annex 4; however, it shall end in any case when the underlying certificate expires.

[**Art. 29** Verification app](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2021/325/en#art_29) 

[1] The FOITT shall provide one or more software programs that can be installed on mobile telephones or similar devices and used for the electronic verification of the authenticity, integrity and validity of COVID-19 certificates, including certificates with data minimisation, and corresponding foreign certificates.

[2] The following principles apply to the software programs:


|    a. They shall verify the authenticity, integrity and validity of COVID-19 certificates without transmitting or storing personal data.  
|    b. They shall verify foreign certificates according to the rules applicable to COVID-19 certificates.  
|    c. They shall issue the result of the verification solely in the following form:  
|    1. verification successful (green background) or unsuccessful (red background) and, if applicable, information on the reasons for the failure of verification;  
|    2. information in accordance with Annex 1 that allows the certificate to be assigned to the holder.


|    d. They can verify the authenticity, integrity and validity of the certificates without being connected to the internet at the time of verification; however, the verification of validity requires an updated list from the system for retrieving revoked certificates, which requires an internet connection.  
|    e. The FOITT shall publish the source code and technical specifications for the software programs it makes available.

[3] Any person who is shown a certificate for verification may not retain it or the information read from it or use it for any purpose other than verification. The foregoing does not apply to storing information on the period of validity of certificates at facilities that may only be accessed by persons who have personal authorisation for repeated access. The data subject must be appropriately informed about the nature and extent of the data processing and must expressly consent to that processing.

[**Art. 30** Access to the systems for issuing COVID-19 certificates and for retrieving revoked COVID-19 certificates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2021/325/en#art_30)
