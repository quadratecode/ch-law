of 16 December 1985 (Status as of 1 April 2020)

The Swiss Federal Council,

on the basis of Articles 12, 13, 16 and 39 of the Federal Act of 7 October 1983 on the Protection of the Environment (the Act),

ordains:

# [Chapter 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#chap_1)

[**Art. 1** Aim and scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_1) 

[1] This Ordinance is intended to protect human beings, animals and plants, their biological communities and habitats, and the soil against harmful effects or nuisances caused by air pollution.

[2] It regulates:


|    a. the preventive limiting of emissions from installations, as defined in Article 7 of the Act, which pollute the air;  
|    a[bis]. open-air waste incineration;  
|    b. requirements for thermal and motor fuels;  
|    c. maximum permitted ambient air pollution levels (ambient limit values);  
|    d. the procedure in the event of excessive ambient air pollution levels.

[**Art. 2** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_2) 

[1] *Stationary installations* means:


|    a. buildings and other fixed structures;  
|    b. terrain modifications;  
|    c. equipment and machines;  
|    d. ventilation systems which collect vehicle flue gases and discharge them as waste air into the environment.

[2] *Vehicles* means motor vehicles, aircraft, ships and railways.

[3] *Transport infrastructure* means roads, airfields, railway tracks and other installations where vehicle flue gases are released into the environment as waste air without being collected.

[4] *New installations* also includes installations which are altered, extended or repaired if:


|    a. higher or different emissions are to be expected as a result; or  
|    b. the costs incurred amount to more than half those of a new installation.

[5] Ambient air pollution levels are *excessive* if one or more of the ambient limit values specified in Annex 7 is exceeded. If no such limit values are specified for a pollutant, ambient air pollution levels shall be considered excessive if:


|    a. they endanger human beings, animals, plants or their biological communities or habitats;  
|    b. a survey establishes that they significantly affect the well-being of a substantial proportion of the population;  
|    c. they damage buildings; or  
|    d. they harm soil fertility, vegetation or waters.

[6] *Placing on the market* means the transfer or disposal for the first time, whether or not for consideration, of equipment or machines for distribution or use in Switzerland. Equivalent to placing on the market is the commissioning, for the first time, of equipment or machines at one's own enterprise in cases where placing on the market has not previously occurred.

# [Chapter 2 Emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#chap_2)

## [Section 1 Limitation of Emissions from New Stationary Installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#chap_2/sec_1)

[**Art. 3** Preventive limiting of emissions in accordance with Annexes 1–4](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_3) 

[1] New stationary installations shall be equipped and operated in such a way that they comply with the emission limits specified in Annex 1.

[2] Additional or different requirements apply in the case of the following installations:


|    a. installations listed in Annex 2: the requirements specified therein;  
|    b. combustion installations: the requirements specified in Annex 3;  
|    c. construction machines and particle filter systems as specified in Article 19*a*, combustion installations as specified in Articles 20 and 20*d* and machines and equipment with internal combustion engines as specified in Article 20*b*: the requirements specified in Annex 4.

[**Art. 4** Preventive emission limits specified by the authorities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_4) 

[1] Emissions for which no limit is specified in this Ordinance or for which a particular limit is declared not to apply, shall be limited preventively by the authorities as far as is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable.

[2] Emission limitation measures are technically and operationally feasible if they:


|    a. have been successfully tested at comparable installations in Switzerland or abroad; or  
|    b. have been successfully applied in experiments and can be transferred to other installations from a technological perspective.

[3] The assessment of the economic acceptability of emission limitations shall be based on an average, economically sound enterprise in the relevant sector. If a particular sector contains widely differing classes of enterprises, the assessment shall be based on an average enterprise of the relevant class.

[**Art. 5** Stricter emission limits ordered by the authorities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_5) 

[1] If an individual planned installation is expected to cause excessive ambient air pollution levels even though the preventive emission limitation requirements are met, the authorities shall order additional or stricter emission limitation requirements for the installation concerned.

[2] The emission limitation requirements are to be supplemented or tightened to such an extent that no excessive ambient air pollution levels are caused.

[**Art. 6** Capture and removal of emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_6)

[1] Emissions shall be captured as fully and as close to the source as possible and shall be removed in such a way as to prevent excessive ambient air pollution levels.

[2] They shall generally be discharged above roof level via stacks or waste air ducts.

[3] Annex 6 applies to stacks. If the required stack height H cannot be realised, or if the parameter H0 is more than 100 m, the authorities shall as an alternative tighten the emission limitation requirements specified in Annexes 1–3.

## [Section 2 Limitation of Emissions from Existing Stationary Installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#chap_2/sec_2)


[**Art. 7** Preventive limiting of emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_7) 

The provisions concerning the preventive limiting of emissions from new stationary installations (Articles 3, 4 and 6) also apply to existing stationary installations.

[**Art. 8** Mandatory retrofitting](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_8) 

[1] The authorities shall ensure that existing stationary installations which do not meet the requirements of this Ordinance undergo retrofitting.

[2] They shall issue the necessary rulings, specifying the time limit for retrofitting in accordance with Article 10. If necessary, they shall order operating restrictions or the shutdown of the installation for the duration of the retrofitting work.

[3] Retrofitting need not be carried out if the owner undertakes to shut down the installation within the time limit set for retrofitting.

[**Art. 9** Stricter emission limits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_9) 

[1] If it is established that an individual existing installation is causing excessive ambient air pollution levels even if the preventive emission limitation requirements are complied with, the authorities shall order additional or stricter emission limitation requirements for the installation concerned.

[2] The emission limitation requirements are to be supplemented or tightened to such an extent that excessive ambient air pollution levels are no longer caused.

[3] The additional or stricter emission limitation requirements are to be imposed by means of retrofitting rulings with time limits set in accordance with Article 10, paragraph 2. If necessary, the authorities shall order operating restrictions or the shutdown of the installation for the duration of the retrofitting work.

[4] If excessive ambient air pollution levels are caused by more than one installation, the procedure specified in Articles 31–34 shall be followed.

[**Art. 10**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_10) [Time limits for retrofitting](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_10) 

[1] The standard time limit for retrofitting is five years.

[2] Shorter time limits, but not less than 30 days, shall be set if:


|    a. retrofitting can be carried out without significant investments;  
|    b. emissions are more than three times the value specified for the preventive limiting of emissions; or  
|    c. ambient air pollution levels caused by the installation alone are excessive.

[3] Longer time limits, up to a maximum of ten years, shall be set if:


|    a. emissions are less than one-and-a-half times the value applicable for the preventive limiting of emissions, or the provisions concerning flue gas losses are not complied with; and  
|    b. neither letter a nor letter c of paragraph 2 is met.

[4] The above is without prejudice to the ordering of shorter time limits for retrofitting in accordance with Article 32.

[**Art. 11** Relief](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_11) 

[1] On request, the authorities shall grant relief to the owner of an installation if retrofitting in accordance with Articles 8 and 10 would be disproportionate, in particular not technically or operationally feasible, or economically unacceptable.

[2] By way of relief, the authorities may in the first instance grant longer time limits. If the granting of longer time limits is not sufficient, the authorities shall specify less strict emission limits.

## [Section 3 Control of Stationary Installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#chap_2/sec_3)

The technical requirements for measurement systems and measurement stability are those specified in the Ordinance of 15 February 2006 on Measuring Instruments and the implementing provisions issued by the Federal Department of Justice and Police.

[3] The owner of the installation to be inspected shall set up and make accessible suitable measuring stations in accordance with instructions issued by the authorities.

[4] The measured and calculated values, the measurement methods used and the operating conditions at the installation at the time the measurements were performed shall be recorded in a measurement report.

[**Art. 15** Assessment of emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_15) 

[1] The measured values shall be corrected to the reference values specified in Annex 1 Number 23.

[2] Unless otherwise specified in Annexes 1–4, the values calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 are to be expressed as hourly mean values for the assessment. In justified cases, the authorities may specify other suitable averaging periods.

[3] In the case of approval and control measurements, emission control requirements shall be regarded as having been complied with if none of the mean values determined in accordance with paragraph 2 exceeds the limit value.

[4] In the case of continuous measurements, emission limit values shall be regarded as having been complied with if, within a calendar year:


|    a. none of the daily mean values exceeds the emission limit value;  
|    b. 97% of all the hourly mean values are no more than 1.2 times the limit value; and  
|    c. none of the hourly mean values is more than twice the limit value.

[5] The authorities shall take account of the particular circumstances when assessing emissions during start-up and shut-down periods.

[**Art. 16** Bypass lines and malfunctions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#art_16) 

[1] A bypass line may only be used to protect flue gas cleaning systems with the approval of the authorities.

Emissions are expressed in the following terms:


|    a. Concentration:  
Mass of emitted substance in relation to the volume of flue gas (e.g. in milligrams per cubic metre [mg/m3]);  
|    b. Mass flow:  
Mass of emitted substance per unit time (e.g. in grams per hour [g/h]);  
|    c. Emission factor:  
Ratio of the mass of emitted substance to the mass of the products generated or processed (e.g. in kilograms per tonne [kg/t]);  
|    d. Emission ratio:  
Ratio of the mass of an air polluting substance emitted to the mass of that substance supplied to the installation in fuels and feedstock (in % (m/m);  
|    e. Smoke number:  
The degree of filter blackening caused by flue gases. The grey scale used to determine the Bacharach smoke number ranges from 0 to 9 in unit steps.

#### [23 Reference value for emission concentrations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_1/lvl_d2775e99/lvl_2/lvl_23)

[1] The limit values expressed as concentrations and the oxygen contents given as reference values are based on the volume of flue gas under standard conditions (0 °C, 1013 mbar) after deduction of the moisture content (dry).

[2] The limit values expressed as emission concentrations are based on the amount of flue gas which is no more heavily diluted than is technically and operationally unavoidable.

[3] If oxygen content by volume is given as the reference value for an installation listed in Annexes 2–4, the measured emission concentrations are to be corrected to this reference value.

[1] If there is more than one emission source and if emission limitation requirements depend on the size of an installation (e.g. capacity or mass flow), the authorities shall determine which emission sources shall collectively be considered to constitute a single installation.

[2] Emission sources are generally to be considered as a single installation if they are situated in close proximity to each other and if their emissions:


|    a. essentially contain the same or similar pollutants; or  
|    b. can be reduced using the same technology.

[3] Parts of an installation which only serve as back-ups in the event of malfunctions are not taken into account when determining the size of the installation.

[4] Emission limit values which depend on a certain mass flow shall only apply if:


|    a. this mass flow is reached or exceeded for more than five hours per week; or  
|    b. double this mass flow is reached or exceeded for a shorter period.

[1] If significant dust emissions may occur in commercial or industrial facilities as a result of processes such as the conveyance, crushing, sorting or filling of dust-forming materials, the dust-containing flue gases must be captured and fed into a dust removal system.

[2] When dust-forming materials are stored or transshipped in the open, measures must be taken to prevent significant dust emissions.

[3] When dust-forming materials are transported, transport equipment must be used which prevents significant dust emissions.

[4] If traffic on factory roads may cause significant dust emissions, the roads must be kept free of dust.

### [5 Inorganic substances, mainly in the form of dust](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_1/lvl_d2775e99/lvl_5)

(Art. 6 para. 3)

## [Minimum stack height](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416)

### [1 Scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416/lvl_1)

The provisions of this Annex apply to installations for which the quantity Q/S exceeds 5, where:

Q = mass flow of the emitted air pollutant in grams per hour;

S = value calculated in accordance with Number 9.

### [2 Calculation method](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416/lvl_2)

[1] The required physical stack height is calculated step by step in accordance with Numbers 3 to 6.

[2] If more than one air pollutant is emitted, the physical stack height is calculated on the basis of the pollutant for which the quantity Q/S has the highest value.

### [3 Parameter H0](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416/lvl_3)

#### [31 Determination of H0 according to Diagram 1](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416/lvl_3/lvl_31)

[1] The parameter H0 takes account of the short-term effects of the air pollutants emitted from a single installation. It is determined with the aid of Diagram 1.

[2] The quantities Q and F depend on the emission conditions at the installation. The full load values and the fuel/emission conditions most conducive to air pollution are used to calculate H0.

[3] The quantity S is used to limit the maximum short-term ambient air pollution levels caused by the installation to a specific value (S value). The S values specified in Number 9 are used to calculate H0.

#### [32 Determination of H0 in individual cases](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416/lvl_3/lvl_32)

[1] The parameter H0 is determined in individual cases according to the recognised rules for calculating the stack height and the dispersion of flue gases if:


|    a. the Q/S or F values lie outside Diagram 1; or  
|    b. the flue gas temperature is less than 55 °C.

[2] However, where flue gas temperatures are below 55 °C, the parameter H0 must not be lower than the value which is obtained according to Diagram 1 for a temperature of 55 °C.

### [4 Minimum height for flat, obstacle-free terrain](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416/lvl_4)

[1] The stack height for flat, obstacle-free terrain is:

H1 = f x H0

The correction factor f takes account of long-term effects due to wind channelling.

[2] Values between 1.0 and 1.5 are used for f as follows:

f = 1.00 for sites with no prevailing wind direction;

f = 1.25 for sites with average conditions;

f = 1.50 for valleys with pronounced wind channelling.

[3] Intermediate values are also possible for f, depending on the site conditions.

### [5 Height increase for buildings and vegetation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416/lvl_5)

Elevated objects (buildings and vegetation) in the vicinity of the stack are taken into account by means of a height increase I1:

I1 = g x I

where:

I = Height of the highest significant obstacle area in the region affected by the installation. Values between 0 (no obstacles) and 30 m (e.g. forest) are used for I.

g = Correction factor, with values between 0 and 1 according to Diagram 2.

### [6 Physical stack height](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416/lvl_6)

The physical stack height H is calculated according to the following formula:

H = H1 + I1

### [7 More stringent requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1986/208_208_208/en#annex_6/lvl_d2775e416/lvl_7)

In justified cases, the authorities will require taller stacks, for example, in the case of:


|    a. structures with particular shapes;  
|    b sites with particularly poor meteorological dispersion conditions;  
|    c. particular topographical conditions, such as narrow valleys, hillsides or depressions.
