|    e. Type E for waste in accordance with Annex 5 number 5.

[2] Landfills may have compartments for different types in accordance with paragraph 1.

[3] Where landfills are made up of two or more compartments, the requirements for the relevant type of waste apply to the compartments concerned.

[**Art. 36** Location and structure of landfills](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/891/en#art_36)

|    b. it is demonstrated that the landfills, with the exception of Type A landfills, cannot harm the environment until the end of the after-care phase;  
|    c. in the case of Type D landfills, only slag is deposited that originates from facilities in which municipal waste or waste of similar composition is incinerated and appropriate measures are taken to prevent the build-up of gases.

[3] In cases where it is permitted under the waters protection legislation to divert a body of flowing water for the construction of a landfill:


|    a. the bodies of water must be diverted around the landfill;  
|    b. it must be ensured that no water can intrude into the landfill.

[2] If landfills comprise compartments for different types, the type of compartment with the largest exploitable minimum volume determines the minimum volume of the entire landfill 

[3] The cantonal authorities may with the FOEN’s consent authorise the construction of landfills with lower volumes if this is appropriate given the geographical circumstances.

[**Art. 38** Authorisation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/891/en#art_38)

The foregoing does not apply to the construction of a Type B landfill or compartment in the zone adjoining exploitable underground waters.  
|    1.1.4 Landfills and compartments of Types A and B that are located above exploitable underground waters or in adjoining zones required for the protection of such waters must lie at least 2 m above the highest maximum natural ten-year groundwater level. In the case of a recharge installation, the actual level of the water table applies if it is higher than the maximum ten-year high.

#### [1.2 Subsoil](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/891/en#annex_2/lvl_d4e88/lvl_1/lvl_d4e91)


|    1.2.1 The subsoil and the surrounding area of the landfill, if necessary, taking account of structural measures, must guarantee the landfill’s long-term stability and prevent any deformation that may in particular adversely affect the proper functioning of the required facilities under number 2.   
|    1.2.2 In the case of landfills and compartments of Type B in the zone adjoining exploitable underground waters and of Types C, D and E, the thickness, homogeneity and ability to retain contaminants of the subsoil and the surrounding area, if necessary taking account of technical improvement measures, must guarantee that the groundwater will not be adversely affected in the long term. The following minimum requirements apply:  
|    a. In the case of Type B landfills and compartments there must be a 2 m thick, largely homogeneous natural geological barrier with a mean hydraulic conductivity (k) of 1.0 × 10-7 m/s or the subsoil must be supplemented according to state-of-the-art civil engineering practice by at least 3 homogenous mineral layers with a mean k of 1.0 × 10-8 m/s that together have an overall thickness of 60 cm. If supplementing the subsoil, only material that satisfies the requirements of Annex 3 number 1 may be used.  
|    b. In the case of landfills of Types C, D and E there must be a 7 m thick, largely homogeneous, natural geological barrier with a mean k of 1.0 × 10[-7] m/s or a 2 m thick, largely homogeneous, natural geological barrier with a mean k of 1.0 × 10[-7] m/s that is supplemented according to state-of-the-art civil engineering practice by at least 3 homogenous mineral layers with a mean k of 1.0 × 10[-9]m/s that together have an overall thickness of 60 cm. When supplementing the subsoil, only material that satisfies the requirements of Annex 3 number 1 may be used.


|    1.2.3 In the case of landfills and compartments of Types C and D, the requirements of number 1.2.2 letter b need not be met if:  
|    a. the landfill or the compartment cannot be constructed at a location that satisfies the requirements of number 1.2.2 letter b;  
|    b. the landfill or the compartment is not constructed on karstic rock; and  
|    c. the subsoil is supplemented according to state-of-the-art civil engineering practice by at least 3 homogenous mineral layers with a mean k of 1.0 × 10[-9]m/s that together have an overall thickness of 80 cm. When supplementing the subsoil, only material that satisfies the requirements of Annex 3 number 1 may be used.


|    1.2.4 Compliance with number 1.2.1 must be verified by foundation analyses and settlement calculations that take account of the waste deposited. Compliance with numbers 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 must be verified by geological and hydrogeological tests. 

### [2 Landfill structure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/891/en#annex_2/lvl_d4e88/lvl_2)

|    2.1.1 The design and selection of materials must guarantee that the required facilities will function safely until the end of the after-care phase. Account must be taken of physical, chemical and biological processes which may occur in the landfill during construction, operation and after closure.  
|    2.1.2 Landfills and compartments of Type B in the zone adjoining exploitable underground waters and of Types C, D and E must be constructed in such a way that the waste water does not accumulate and can drain away freely by gravity to the point of entry into a body of water or the public sewer system.

|    2.2.1 The base and sides of landfills and compartments of Types C, D and E must be sealed with a liner that prevents the leaching of waste water during operations and until the end of the after-care phase, and which allows waste water to collect. The following are permitted:  
|    a. Mineral liner: it must be at least 80 cm thick and have a mean k of less than or equal to 1 x 10-9 m/s. It must be installed in at least three layers and each layer must be compacted separately and protected against drying out.   
|    b. Liner made of an asphalt: it must be at least 7 cm thick, be laid on a suitable foundation and binder layer and compacted so that the cavity content, measured by means of a sample, is no more than 3 per cent.  
|    c. Liner made of plastic membrane: it must be at least 2.5 mm thick and be laid on a mineral seal constructed in accordance with letter a that is at least 50 cm thick.  
|    d. Other liners: laboratory and field tests must prove that these are at least equivalent to the liners described in letters a–c.


|    2.2.2 When selecting and fitting the liner, account must be taken of the structure of the subsoil, the slope of the base and sides of the landfill and the characteristics of the drainage layer.  
|    2.2.3 Only mineral materials that satisfy the requirements of Annex 3 number 1 may be used for mineral liners.  
|    2.2.4 The efficacy of the liners must be tested and documented during construction and before the covering.
