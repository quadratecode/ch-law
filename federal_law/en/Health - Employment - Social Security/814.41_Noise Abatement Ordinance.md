# [Chapter 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#chap_1)

[**Art. 1** Aim and scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_1) 

[1] This Ordinance is intended to protect against harmful and disturbing noise.

[2] It regulates:


|    a. the limitation of exterior noise emissions caused by the operation of new and existing installations in accordance with Article 7 of the Act;  
|    b. the designation and development of building zones in areas exposed to noise;  
|    c. the issuing of planning permission for buildings with rooms sensitive to noise and lying in areas exposed to noise;  
|    d. the soundproofing against exterior and interior noise of new buildings with rooms sensitive to noise;  
|    e. the soundproofing against exterior noise of existing buildings with rooms sensitive to noise;  
|    f. the determination of the exposure to exterior noise and its rating based on exposure limit values.

[3] It does not regulate:


|    a. protection against noise originating from an industrial site as long as this only affects industrial buildings and dwellings within the site;  
|    b. protection against infra- and ultrasound.

4…

[**Art. 2** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_2) 

[1] Stationary installations are buildings, transport facilities, building facilities and other immobile equipment that generate exterior noise during operation. These include in particular roads, railway installations, aerodromes, industrial, commercial and agricultural installations, firing ranges and permanent military firing ranges and training grounds.

[2] New stationary installations also include stationary installations and buildings whose use has been completely altered.

[3] Emission limitation measures are technical, structural or functional modifications to installations, or measures to redirect, restrict or calm the flow of traffic, or structural measures along the emission path. The purpose of the measures is to prevent or reduce the generation or propagation of exterior noise.

[4] Improvements are emission limitation measures for existing stationary installations.

[5] Exposure limit values include impact thresholds, planning values and alarm values. These are set according to the noise characteristics, the time of day and the sensitivity to noise of the buildings and areas to be protected.

[6] Rooms sensitive to noise are:


|    a. rooms in dwellings with the exception of kitchens without dining facilities, washrooms and storerooms;  
|    b. rooms in industrial buildings that are regularly occupied by persons for sustained periods of time, with the exception of those for farm animals and those with high levels of industrial noise.

# [Chapter 2 Vehicles, Mobile Appliances and Machines](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#chap_2)

## [Section 1 Emission Limitation Measures from Vehicles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#chap_2/sec_1)

[**Art. 3**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_3) 

[1] Noise emitted from motorised vehicles, aircraft, water craft and railways must be reduced as far as possible by technical and operational means, and to the extent that this is economically acceptable.

[2] Emission limitation measures are governed by the legislation on road traffic, civil aviation, inland navigation or the railways, provided the vehicle concerned is covered by one of these categories of legislation. 

[3] Emission limitation measures for other vehicles is governed by the provisions on mobile appliances and machines.

## [Section 2 Emission Limitation Measures for Mobile Appliances and Machines](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#chap_2/sec_2)


[**Art. 4** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_4) 

[1] The emissions of exterior noise from mobile appliances and machines must be reduced to the extent that:


|    a. this is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable; and that  
|    b. the well-being of the affected population is not seriously impaired.

[2] The enforcement authorities shall order operational and structural measures, or those for proper maintenance.

[3] Where it is not possible to avoid exposure to highly disturbing noise due to the operation of military equipment, machines and weapons, the enforcement authorities shall relax the requirements.

[4] The emissions of appliances and machines that are used to operate a stationary installation are limited according to the provisions on stationary installations.

[**Art. 5**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_5) [Conformity assessment and marking of equipment and machines](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_5) 

[1] Equipment and machines may be placed on the market only following a conformity assessment and the appropriate marking.

[2] The Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) shall specify:


|    a. the types of equipment and machines subject to the conformity assessment and marking;  
|    b. the requirements for preventive emission limitation measures and marking, taking into account internationally recognised standards;  
|    c. the documents to be submitted for the purpose of the conformity assessment;  
|    d. the test, measurement and calculation procedures;  
|    e. the subsequent controls;  
|    f. the recognition of foreign test results and labelling.

[**Art. 6** Regulationson noise from building sites](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_6) 

The Federal Office for the Environment shall issue regulations covering structural and operational measures to control noise from building sites.

# [Chapter 3 New and Modified Stationary Installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#chap_3)

[**Art. 7** Emission limitation measures for new stationary installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_7) 

[1] Noise emissions from new stationary installations shall be limited as directed by the enforcement authorities insofar as:


|    a. this is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable; and  
|    b. the noise exposure level resulting from the installation alone does not exceed the planning values.

[2] The enforcement authorities shall relax the requirements in cases where compliance with the planning values would place a disproportionate burden on the installation and there is an overriding public interest, particularly regarding questions of spatial planning. The impact thresholds must not, however, be exceeded.

[**Art. 8** Emission limitation measures for modified stationary installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_8) 

[1] Where a stationary installation that already exists when this Ordinance comes into force is modified, the noise emissions from the new or modified parts of the installation must be limited as directed by the enforcement authorities as far as this is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable.

[2] If the installation is significantly modified, the noise emissions from the installation as a whole must be limited at least to the extent that the impact thresholds are not exceeded.

[3] Conversions, extensions and operational changes carried out by the person responsible for the installation constitute significant modifications to stationary installations if it is anticipated that the noise exposure level will rise perceptibly as a result either of the installation itself or of the increased demand on existing transport facilities. The rebuilding of an installation constitutes a significant modification irrespective of the circumstances.

[4] If a new stationary installation is modified, Article 7 applies.

[**Art. 9** Increased demand on transport facilities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_9) 

The operation of new or significantly modified stationary installations must not lead to a situation in which:


|    a. owing to the increased demand made on a transport facility, the impact thresholds are exceeded; or  
|    b. owing to the increased demand made on a transport facility in need of remediation, the noise exposure level rises perceptibly.

[**Art. 10** Soundproofing measures in existing buildings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_10) 

[1] If the requirements specified in Articles 7 paragraph 2 and 8 paragraph 2 or in Article 9 are not fulfilled by new or significantly modified public or licensed stationary installations, the enforcement authorities shall require the owners of existing buildings exposed to noise to soundproof the windows of rooms sensitive to noise in accordance with Annex 1.

2 With the approval of the enforcement authorities, building owners may carry out other structural soundproofing measures provided these reduce the noise within the rooms to the same extent.

[3] Soundproofing measures need not be taken if:


|    a. no perceptible reduction of the noise level in the building is to be expected;  
|    b. they conflict with the overriding interest of preserving local character or monuments;  
|    c. the building is due to be demolished within three years of putting the new or modified installation into service, or the rooms concerned will be converted to purposes not sensitive to noise within this period.

[**Art. 11** Costs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_11) 

[1] The person responsible for the new or significantly modified installation bears the costs of limiting the emission it causes.

[2] If the building owner is required to take soundproofing measures according to Article 10 paragraph 1, the person responsible for the installation also bears the customary local costs proven to be due for: 


|    a. engineering and supervision of works;  
|    b. soundproofing of the windows in accordance with Annex 1 and the resulting necessary adaptations;  
|    c. the financing if the person responsible has failed to contribute despite being requested to do so by the building owner;  
|    d. any fees due.

[3] If the building owner is required to take soundproofing measures according to Article 10 paragraph 2, the person responsible for the installation bears the customary local costs proven to be due insofar as these do not exceed those under paragraph 2. The building owner bears the remaining costs.

[4] Where the need for emission limitation measures or soundproofing measures arises as a result of noise from several installations, the costs are divided among the installations in proportion to their contribution to the noise exposure level.

[5] The building owner bears the costs for maintenance and renewal of the soundproofing measures.

[**Art. 12** Inspection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_12) 

The enforcement authorities shall inspect the new or modified installation within one year of its being put into service to check whether the emission limitation and soundproofing measures ordered have been taken. In the event of any doubt, they carry out tests to assess the effectiveness of the measures.

# [Chapter 4 Existing Stationary Installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#chap_4)

## [Section 1 Improvements and Soundproofing Measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#chap_4/sec_1)

[**Art. 13** Improvements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_13) 

[1] In the case of stationary installations that contribute significantly to the impact thresholds being exceeded, the enforcement authorities shall order the necessary improvement measures, after hearing the persons responsible for the installations.

[2] The installations shall be improved to the extent that:


|    a. is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable; and  
|    b. the impact thresholds are no longer exceeded.

[3] Unless there are overriding interests, the enforcement authorities give priority to measures which prevent or reduce noise generation in preference to those which simply prevent or reduce noise propagation.

[4] Improvements need not be carried out if:


|    a. the impact thresholds are exceeded only in building zones that have not yet been developed;  
|    b. due to the cantonal building and planning legislation, planning, design or structural measures taken at the site exposed to the noise will satisfy the impact thresholds before the time limit specified in Article 17.

[**Art. 14** Relaxation of the requirements for improvements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_14) 

[1] The enforcement authorities shall relax the requirements in cases where:


|    a. improvements would result in unreasonable operational limitations or costs;  
|    b. overriding interests, namely those of the preservation of local character, nature and landscape protection, traffic and operational safety, or national security, conflict with the improvement objective.

[2] Unlicensed private installations must not, however, exceed the alarm values.

[**Art. 15** Soundproofing measures for existing buildings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_15) 

[1] If, as a result of relaxing the requirements, the alarm values for public or licensed stationary installations cannot be complied with, the enforcement authorities shall require the owners of existing buildings exposed to noise to soundproof the windows of rooms sensitive to noise in accordance with Annex 1.

[2] With the approval of the enforcement authorities, building owners may take other soundproofing measures in the building provided these reduce the noise within the rooms to the same extent.

[3] Soundproofing measures need not be taken if:


|    a. no perceptible reduction of noise in the building is to be expected;  
|    b. they conflict with the overriding interest of preserving local character or monuments;  
|    c. the building is due to be demolished within three years of the soundproofing measures being ordered, or the rooms will be converted to purposes not sensitive to noise within this period.

[**Art. 16** Costs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_16) 

[1] The person responsible for the installation bears the costs of its improvement.

[2] The person responsible for a public or licensed installation also bears the costs of soundproofing measures for existing buildings under Article 11, unless an exemption has been granted under Article 20 paragraph 2 of the Act.

[3] Where improvements or soundproofing measures are required as a result of noise from several installations, the costs are divided among the installations in proportion to their contribution to the noise exposure level.

[4] The building owner bears the costs of maintenance and renewal of the soundproofing measures.

[**Art. 17** Time limits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_17) 

[1] The enforcement authorities set the time limits for implementing improvements and soundproofing measures according to their urgency. 

[2] In assessing urgency, the following factors are decisive:


|    a. the extent to which the impact thresholds are exceeded;  
|    b. the number of persons affected by the noise;  
|    c. the cost-benefit relationship.

[3] The improvements and soundproofing measures must be completed within 15 years of this Ordinance coming into force.

[4] The time limit (para. 3) for improvements and soundproofing measures on roads are extended:


|    for national roads until 31 March 2015;   
|    for trunk roads according to Article 12 of the Federal Act of 22 March 1985 on the Application of the Earmarked Mineral Oil Tax (MinOA), and for other roads until 31 March 2018. 

[5] The time limits specified in the Federal Act of 24 March 2000 on Railways Noise Abatement apply to the completion of improvements and soundproofing measures on railway installations.

[6] The improvements and soundproofing measures must be completed: 


|    at military aerodromes by 31 July 2020;   
|    at civil aerodromes that are used by heavy aircraft by 31 May 2016;   
|    at civil shooting ranges that require compulsory improvements as a result of the Amendment of 23 August 2006 of Annex 7: by 1 November 2016;   
|    at military firing ranges and training grounds: by 31 July 2025. 

[**Art. 18** Inspection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_18) 

Within one year of completion, the enforcement authorities shall inspect the improvements and soundproofing measures to check compliance with the measures ordered. In case of doubt, they carry out tests to assess the effectiveness of the measures.

[**Art. 19**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_19)

[**Art. 20**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_20) [Periodical surveys](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_20) 

[1] The Federal Office for the Environment shall enquire regularly of the enforcement authorities as to the status of the improvements and the noise protection measures, in particular concerning roads, railway installations, aerodromes, shooting ranges and military shooting ranges and training areas.

[2] For roads, the enforcement authorities must provide the following documents in particular by 31 March each year:

[**Art. 29** Designation of new building zones and new zones with higher noise abatement requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_29) 

[1] New building zones for buildings with rooms sensitive to noise and new no-build zones with higher noise abatement requirements shall be designated only in areas in which noise exposure does not exceed the planning values or in which these values can be complied with by planning, design or structural measures.

2… 

[**Art. 30**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_30) [Development of building zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_30) 

Building zones for buildings with rooms sensitive to noise that have not yet been developed when the Act comes into force may only be developed to the extent that the planning values are complied with or can be complied with by a change in the type of use, or by planning, design or structural measures. The enforcement authorities may grant exceptions for small sections of building zones.

[**Art. 31** Planning permission in areas subject to noise](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_31) 

[1] If the impact thresholds are exceeded, new buildings and significant modifications to buildings with rooms sensitive to noise may only be authorised if the values can be complied with:


|    by locating the rooms sensitive to noise on the side of the building away from the source of the noise; or   
|    by structural or design measures which shield the building against noise. 

[2] If the impact thresholds cannot be complied with by measures under paragraph 1, planning permission may be granted only if there is an overriding interest in constructing the building and the cantonal authorities agree.

[3] The landowners bear the costs of the measures.

[**Art. 32** Requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_32) 

[1] The project owner of a new building shall ensure that the soundproofing of the external building elements and partitions of rooms sensitive to noise, and of the stairs and building facilities complies with recognised codes of building practice. These are in particular, for noise from civil aerodromes that are used by heavy aircraft, the stricter requirements, and for noise from other stationary installations, the minimum requirements, of SIA Standard No 181 of the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects.

[2] If the impact thresholds are exceeded but the requirements of Article 31 paragraph 2 for granting planning permission are fulfilled, the enforcement authorities shall impose stricter requirements for the soundproofing of the external building elements appropriately.

[3] The requirements also apply to the external building elements, partitions, stairways and building facilities that are converted, replaced or newly installed. On request, the enforcement authorities grant relief if compliance with the requirements would involve unreasonable cost.

[**Art. 33** External building elements, partitions and building facilities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_33) 

[1] External building elements form the external boundary of a room (e.g. windows, external doors, external walls, roofs).

[2] Partitions (e.g. internal walls, ceilings, doors) serve to separate individual units, such as dwellings, within the building.

[3] Building facilities are fixed installations such as heating, ventilation, supply and disposal systems, lifts and washing machines.

[**Art. 34** Application for planning permission](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_34) 

[1] The project owner must specify in the application:


|    a. the exterior noise pollution in the event that the impact thresholds are exceeded;  
|    b. the use to which the rooms are put;  
|    c. the external building elements and partitions of rooms sensitive to noise.

[2] For building projects in areas in which the impact thresholds are exceeded, the enforcement authorities may demand details of the soundproofing of the external building elements.

[**Art. 35** Inspections](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_35)

[1] The enforcement authorities state the permitted noise exposure level in their decision on the construction, alteration or improvement of an installation.

[2] If it is established or anticipated that the noise exposure levels due to an installation will deviate significantly and permanently from those quoted in the decision, the enforcement authorities shall take the necessary measures.

[3] The Federal Office for the Environment may issue recommendations on the standardised recording and presentation of the noise exposure levels in these decisions.

[**Art. 38** Method of determination](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_38) 

[1] Noise exposure levels are determined in the form of a rating sound level, Lr, or a maximum sound level, Lmax, on the basis of calculations or measurements.

[2] Noise exposure levels due to aircraft shall principally be determined by calculation. The calculations are carried out using recognised state-of-the-art methods. The Federal Office for the Environment shall recommend suitable calculation procedures.

[3] The requirements for calculation procedures and measuring instruments are given in Annex 2.

[**Art. 39** Point of determination](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_39) 

[1] For buildings, noise exposure levels shall be determined at the centre of open windows in rooms sensitive to noise. Noise exposure levels due to aircraft may also be determined in the vicinity of the building.

[2] In the non-developed sector of zones with higher noise abatement requirements, noise exposure levels shall be measured 1.5 m above the ground.

[3] In building zones that have not yet been developed, noise exposure levels shall be measured at points where the building and planning legislation allows the building of rooms sensitive to noise.

[2] They also apply:


|    in yet undeveloped building zones in areas where the construction of buildings with rooms sensitive to noise is allowed under the building and planning legislation;   
|    in the non-developed areas of zones with higher noise abatement requirements. 

[3] For areas and buildings in which, as a rule, people are present either only during the day or only at night, no exposure limit values apply at night or during the day.

[**Art. 42** Special exposure limit values for rooms in industrial buildings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_42) 

[1] For rooms in industrial buildings (Art. 2 para. 6 let. b) lying in areas of sensitivity levels I, II or III, the planning and impact thresholds shall be increased by 5 dB(A).

[2] Paragraph 1 does not apply to rooms in schools, institutions and homes. It applies to hotels and guesthouses only if these can be adequately ventilated when the windows are closed.

[**Art. 43** Sensitivity levels](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_43)

|    sensitivity level I in zones with higher noise abatement requirements, notably in leisure zones;   
|    sensitivity level II in zones in which operations that emit noise are not permitted, notably in residential zones and zones for public buildings and installations;   
|    sensitivity level III in zones in which operations emitting a certain level of noise are permitted, notably in residential and industrial zones (mixed zones) and agricultural zones;   
|    sensitivity level IV in zones in which operations emitting a high level of noise are permitted, notably in industrial zones. 

[2] Parts of land use zones rated as sensitivity levels I or II may be assigned the next higher level if they are already exposed to noise.

[**Art. 44** Procedures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#art_44) 

[1] The cantons shall ensure that sensitivity levels are assigned to the land use zones in the building regulations or land use plans of the communes.

[2] The sensitivity levels are assigned at the time of designation or modification of the land use zones, or at the time of modification of the building regulations.

## [Requirements for the Calculation Procedures and Measuring Instruments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_2/lvl_d1755e84)

### [1 Calculation Procedures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_2/lvl_d1755e84/lvl_1)

[1] The procedures used to calculate noise exposure levels must take account of:


|    the emissions from the noise source of the installation;   
|    the distance between the exposure point and the noise source of the installation or the flight paths (attenuation due to propagation and dissipation);   
|    the influence of the ground on the propagation of the noise (ground effects);   
|    the influence of buildings and natural obstacles on the propagation of the noise (attenuation due to obstacles and reflection). 

[2] The Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) recommends suitable state-of-the-art calculation procedures to the enforcement authorities.

### [2 Measuring Instruments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_2/lvl_d1755e84/lvl_2)

### [3 Determination of the Rating Sound Level](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_3/lvl_d1755e89/lvl_3)

#### [31 Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_3/lvl_d1755e89/lvl_3/lvl_31)

[1] The rating sound level Lr for road traffic noise is determined from the partial rating sound levels for motor vehicle noise (Lr1) and railway noise (Lr2) as follows:

Lr = 10 x log (100,1 x Lr1 + 100,1 x Lr2 )

[2] The partial rating sound level Lr1 is the sum of the equivalent continuous A‑weighted sound level Leq,m resulting from motor vehicles, and the level correction K1:

Lr1 = Leq,m + K1

[3] The partial rating sound level Lr2 is the sum of the equivalent continuous A‑weighted sound level Leq,b resulting from the railways, and the level correction K2:

Lr2 = Leq,b + K2

[4] The partial rating sound levels Lr1 and Lr2 are determined for average day and night traffic flows assuming a dry road surface.

#### [32 Average Day and Night Traffic](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_3/lvl_d1755e89/lvl_3/lvl_32)

[1] The average day and night traffic is defined as the annual average of the hourly traffic between 06 and 22 hours and between 22 and 06 hours.

[2] The hourly motor vehicle traffic during the day (Nt) and at night (Nn) are each divided into two partial traffic flows, Nt1 and Nt2, and Nn1 and Nn2, respectively.

[3] The partial traffic flows Nt1 and Nn1 for motor vehicle traffic include private cars, delivery vehicles, minibuses, motorcycles and trolley buses.

[4] The partial traffic flows Nt2 and Nn2 for motor vehicle traffic comprise lorries, articulated lorries, coaches, motorcycles and tractors.

[5] Railway traffic comprises all scheduled and non-scheduled trains, including service journeys.

#### [33 Determination of Average Day and Night Motor Vehicle Traffic](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_3/lvl_d1755e89/lvl_3/lvl_33)

[1] The average day and night traffic (Nt, Nn) and the partial traffic flows (Nt1, Nt2, Nn1, Nn2) are determined:


|    from traffic surveys for existing roads;   
|    from forecasts of traffic volume for roads which are to be built or modified. 

[2] Where insufficient data is available from traffic surveys, or no detailed forecasts exist, the traffic flows Nt, Nn, Nt1, Nt2, Nn1 and Nn2 are calculated from the average daily traffic (ADT; vehicles per 24 h) as follows:

Nt     =    0.058 ADT Nn     =    0.009 ADT

Nt1   =    0.90 Nt Nn1   =    0.95 Nn

Nt2   =    0.10 Nt Nn2   =    0.05 Nn

[3] The ADT is determined according to the recognised principles of traffic planning and traffic technology.

#### [34 Determination of the Average Day and Night Traffic for Railways](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_3/lvl_d1755e89/lvl_3/lvl_34)

The average day and night traffic for railways is determined:


|    from the timetable and traffic data for existing railway installations;   
|    from traffic volume forecasts for railway installations which are to be built or modified. 

#### [35 Level Corrections](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_3/lvl_d1755e89/lvl_3/lvl_35)

[1] The level correction K1 for motor vehicle noise is calculated as follows from the average day and night traffic:

K1   =   –5 for N < 31.6

K1   =   10 log(N/100) for 31.6 ≤ N ≤ 100

K1   =     0 for N > 100

Here, N stands for the hourly motor vehicle traffic Nt or Nn. 

[2] The K2 level correction for railway noise is equal to -5. For screeching railway noise that occurs frequently and is clearly audible, the K2 level correction is equal to 0.

# [Annex 4](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_4)

## [Exposure Limit Values for Railway Noise](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_4/lvl_d1755e100)

### [1 Scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_4/lvl_d1755e100/lvl_1)

[1] The exposure limit values specified in Number 2 apply to the noise from standard and narrow gauge railways.

[2] Noise on roads arising from railways is considered equivalent to road traffic noise (Annex 3 Number 1).

[3] The noise from cable railways and railway workshops, energy installations and similar railway works, is considered equivalent to noise from industrial and commercial installations (Annex 6 Number 1).

### [2 Exposure Limit Values](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_4/lvl_d1755e100/lvl_2)

### [3 Determination of the Rating Sound Level](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_4/lvl_d1755e100/lvl_3)

#### [31 Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_4/lvl_d1755e100/lvl_3/lvl_31)

[1] The rating sound level Lr for railway noise is determined from the partial rating sound levels for vehicle noise (Lr1) and shunting noise (Lr2) as follows:

Lr = 10 x log (10[0,1 x Lr1] + 10[0,1 x Lr2])

[2] The partial rating sound level Lr1 is the sum of the equivalent continuous A‑weighted sound level Leq,f resulting from vehicle operation, and the level correction K1:

Lr1 = Leq,f + K1

[3] The partial rating sound level Lr2 is the sum of the equivalent continuous A‑weighted sound level Leq,r resulting from shunting, and the level correction K2:

Lr2 = Leq,r + K2

[4] The partial rating sound levels Lr1 and Lr2 are determined for average day and night traffic flows.

#### [32 Average Day and Night Operations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_4/lvl_d1755e100/lvl_3/lvl_32)

[1] Average day and night operations are hauling and shunting operations from 06 to 22 hours and from 22 to 06 hours respectively, averaged over the year.

[2] Vehicle operations comprise all scheduled and non-scheduled trains, including service journeys.

[3] Shunting comprises all shunting movements and operations intended for the purpose of connecting and disconnecting trains.

[4] Vehicle operations and shunting are determined:

[1] The level correction K1 for transport noise is calculated as follows:

K1   =   –15 for N < 7.9

K1   =   10 log (N/250) for 7.9 ≤ N ≤ 79

K1   =   −5 for N > 79

Here, N stands for the number of train journeys per day or night.

[2] The level correction K2 for shunting noise is based on the frequency and audibility of all pulsating, tonal and screeching types of noise, and is equal to:

### [3 Determination of the Rating Sound Level Lrk for Light Aircraft Noise](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_5/lvl_d1755e108/lvl_3)

#### [31 Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_5/lvl_d1755e108/lvl_3/lvl_31)

[1] The rating sound level Lrk for light aircraft noise is the sum of the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound level Leqk and the level correction K:

Lrk = Leqk + K

[2] The equivalent continuous sound level Leqk is determined for the average number of hourly aircraft movements (number of movements n) for a day with average peak operations.

[3] Aircraft movements are all landings and takeoffs of light aircraft. Go-arounds count as two flight movements.

#### [32 Number of Aircraft Movements n for existing Civil Aerodromes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_5/lvl_d1755e108/lvl_3/lvl_32)

For existing civil aerodromes, the number of aircraft movements n is determined as follows:


|    the six months with the greatest amount of traffic during the operating year are identified;   
|    for these six months, the average daily number of flight movements is determined separately for each of the seven days of the week. The average daily values for the two days of the week with the most traffic are designated as N1 and N2;   
|    n is determined by averaging N1 and N2 over the twelve daytime hours as follows:   
|     n = (N1 + N2)/24

#### [33 Number of Aircraft Movements n for new Civil Aerodromes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_5/lvl_d1755e108/lvl_3/lvl_33)

[1] For civil aerodromes which are to be built or modified, the number of flight movements n is determined from forecasts of traffic volume.

[2] If no detailed forecasts can be made, n is calculated from the forecasted annual number of aircraft movements N as follows:

n = (N x 2,4)/(365 x 12)

#### [34 Level Corrections](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_5/lvl_d1755e108/lvl_3/lvl_34)

The level correction K is calculated from the annual number of aircraft movements N as follows:

K = 0 for N < 15 000

K = 10 x log (N/15 000) for N ≥ 15 000

### [4 Determination of the Rating Sound Level Lr for Traffic at Civil Aerodromes used by Heavy Aircraft](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_5/lvl_d1755e108/lvl_4)

[1] At civil aerodromes used by heavy aircraft, the rating sound level Lr of total traffic is determined based on the relevant aircraft traffic, whereby separate calculations are made for daytime (06-22 hours), and for the first (22-23 hours), second (23-24 hours) and last (05-06 hours) night hours.

[2] At civil aerodromes used by heavy aircraft, the daytime rating sound level for total traffic Lrt is calculated from the rating sound levels for light aircraft Lrk and heavy aircraft Lrg as follows:

Lrt = 10 x log (10 [0,1 x]*[Lr]**k*[]+ 10 [0,1 x]*[Lr]**g*)

[3] For heavy aircraft noise, the daytime rating sound level is the sum of the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound level Leqg arising from aircraft operations between 06 and 22 hours, averaged over one year:

Lrg = Leqg 

[4] For heavy aircraft noise, the rating sound level Lrn for the first, the second and the last night hour is the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound level Leqn, each averaged over one hour, arising from aircraft operations during the periods 22-23, 23-24 hours and 05-06 hours, averaged over one year:

Lrn = Leqn

#### [42 Relevant Aircraft Traffic](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_5/lvl_d1755e108/lvl_4/lvl_42)

[1] The equivalent continuous sound levels Leqg and Leqn are determined from the operational data.

[2] For civil aerodromes that are to be built or modified, the relevant aircraft traffic is determined from forecasts of traffic volume.

[3] Flights taking place after the second night hour (23-24 hours) and before the last night hour (05-06) are assigned to the second night hour (23-24 hours).

### [5 Determination of the Average Maximum Noise Level max for Heliports](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_5/lvl_d1755e108/lvl_5)

[1] The rating sound level Lr for industrial, commercial and similar types of noise is determined from the partial rating sound levels Lr,i for each noise phase as follows, whereby separate calculations are made for daytime (07 to 19 hours) and night-time (19 to 07 hours):

![](https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/20210701/en/html/image/image7.png)

[2] The partial rating sound level Lr,i is determined for the average daily duration of the noise phase i as follows:

Lr,i = Leq,i + K1,i + K2,i + K3,i + 10 x log (ti/to)

where:

Leq,i is the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound level during the noise phase i;

K1,i is the level correction for the noise phase i;

K2,i is the level correction for the noise phase i;

K3,i is the level correction for the noise phase i;

ti is the average daily duration of the noise phase i in minutes;

to = 720 minutes.

[3] Noise phases are time periods in which the exposure point is subject to uniform noise with respect to sound level, frequency and pulse content.

#### [32 Average Daily Duration of Noise Phases](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_6/lvl_d1755e128/lvl_3/lvl_32)

[1] The average daily duration (ti) of the noise phase i is calculated from its annual duration (Ti) and the annual number of working days (B) as follows:

ti = Ti/B

[2] For new or modified installations, the average daily duration of the noise phase i is determined from operational forecasts.

#### [33 Level Corrections](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_6/lvl_d1755e128/lvl_3/lvl_33)

| |    c. for noise according to with Number 1 paragraph 1 letter d | 0 by day5 at night |
| |    d. for noise according to Number 1 paragraph 1 letter e | 5 by day10 at night. |

[2] The level correction K2 takes account of the audibility of the tonality content of the noise at the point of exposure and is equal to:


|    a. for non-audible tonality content 0  
|    b. for weakly audible tonality content 2  
|    c. for clearly audible tonality content 4  
|    d. for strongly audible tonality content 6.

### [1 Scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_7/lvl_d1755e137/lvl_1)

[1] The exposure limit values specified in Number 2 apply to the noise from civil firing range installations at which only hand guns or small arms are used to fire at stationary or moving targets.

[2] The hand guns or small arms used at the firing range installations are allocated to the following weapons categories:


|    assault rifles and portable firearms of comparable calibre;   
|    small arms with centre fire cartridges, in particular ordnance pistols;   
|    small arms with rim fire cartridges;   
|    portable firearms with rim fire cartridges;   
|    sporting guns with ball cartridges;   
|    shotguns;   
|    other firearms. 

[3] Firing range installations are public if they are used for shooting practice in accordance with Articles 62 and 63 of the Armed Forces Act of 3 February 1995.

### [2 Exposure Limit Values](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_7/lvl_d1755e137/lvl_2)

|  |  |  |  |

For noise from public installations according to Number 1 paragraph 3, at which, for weapons in categories a or b, the level correction Ki < –15, no alarm values apply. For such installations, no soundproofing measures under Article 15 are required. The level correction Ki is calculated as specified in Number 321.

### [3 Determination of rating sound level](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_7/lvl_d1755e137/lvl_3)

[1] The rating sound level Lr for the noise from firing range installations is the energetic sum of the partial rating sound level Lri for the weapons categories:

![](https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/20210701/en/html/image/image8.png)

[2] The partial rating sound level Lri is the sum of the average single shot sound level Li of a weapons category and the level correction Ki:

Lri = Li + Ki

[3] The average single shot sound level Li is the energetic average weighted according to the number of shots of the energetically averaged single shot sound level Lj of a type of weapon or type of ammunition:

![](https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/20210701/en/html/image/image9.png)

[4] The energetically averaged single shot sound level Lj must be determined using the measurements of the A-weighted maximum sound level with the FAST time constants.

Where:

Mj is the number of shots fired annually using a single type of weapon or a single type of ammunition of a weapons category, averaged over three years;

Mi is the number of shots fired annually using weapons of a single category, averaged over three years.

#### [32 Level Correction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_7/lvl_d1755e137/lvl_3/lvl_32)

##### [321 Calculation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_7/lvl_d1755e137/lvl_3/lvl_32/lvl_321)

[1] The level correction Ki is calculated as follows:

Ki = 10 x log (Dwi + 3 x Dsi) + 3 x log Mi – 44

Where:

Dwi is the number of annual firing half-days falling on a weekday, averaged over three years, for each weapons category;

Dsi is the number of annual firing half-days falling on a Sunday or a general public holiday, averaged over three years, for each weapons category.

[2] When determining the number of firing half-days and the number of shots, all exercises that take place regularly over a period of three years must be taken into account.

##### [322 Determination of the number of firing half-days](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_7/lvl_d1755e137/lvl_3/lvl_32/lvl_322)

[1] Any firing exercise taking place in the morning or in the afternoon and lasting more than two hours counts as a firing half-day. Exercises lasting two hours or less count as half a firing half-day.

[2] For new or modified firing range installations, the number of firing half-days is determined on the basis of operational forecasts. For existing firing range installations, the number of firing half-days is determined by counting.

##### [323 Determination of the number of shots](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_7/lvl_d1755e137/lvl_3/lvl_32/lvl_323)

[1] For existing firing range installations, the number of shots Mi per weapons category is determined from the operational logs.

[2] If the operational logs of existing firing range installations are incomplete or if the firing range installations are new or have been modified, the number of shots M is determined from forecasts of future use.

[1] The rating sound level Lr for noise from military aerodromes is calculated from the rating sound levels Lrm for military aircraft noise and Lrz for civil aircraft noise, as follows:

*Lr* = 10 × log (10[0,1][×]*[Lr]**[m]*[]+ 10[0,1][×]*[Lr]**[z]*)

[2] The rating sound level Lrz is determined in the same way as the corresponding Lr for civil aerodromes specified in Annex 5 Numbers 3 and 4.

[3] The rating sound level Lrm is determined from the partial rating sound levels Lrj, for noise from jet aircraft, and Lrp, for noise from propeller aircraft, as follows:

*Lr**m* = 10 × log (10[0,1][×]*[Lr]**[j]*[]+ 10[0,1][×]*[Lr]**[p]*)

[4] The partial rating sound level Lrj is the sum of the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound level Leqj arising from the operation of jet aircraft, and the level corrections K0 and K1:

Lrj = Leqj + K0 + K1

[5] The partial rating sound level Lrp is the sum of the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound level Leqp arising from the operation of propeller aircraft, and the level corrections K0 and K2:

Lrp = Leqp + K0 + K2

[6] The equivalent continuous sound levels Leqj and Leqp are calculated for the average number of hourly flight movements for a day with an average level of traffic, whereby flight movements of jet aircraft and propeller aircraft are counted separately (number of flight movements nj and np).

[7] Flight movements are all takeoffs and landings of jet and propeller aircraft. Go-arounds count as two flight movements.

#### [32 Numbers of Flight Movements nj and np for Military Aerodromes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_8/lvl_d1755e148/lvl_3/lvl_32)

[1] For existing military aerodromes, the number of flight movements nj and np are determined as follows:


|    a. the six months of the operating year with the greatest amount of traffic are identified, whereby flight movements of jet aircraft and propeller aircraft are counted separately;  
|    b. for these six months, the number of flight movements of jet aircraft Mj and propeller aircraft Mp are determined;  
|    c. the numbers of flight movements nj and np are calculated from Mj and Mp by averaging them over 130 days and twelve daytime hours:  
|     nj = Mj/(12 x 130) np = Mp/(12 x 130)

[2] For military aerodromes that are to be built or modified, the numbers of flight movements nj and np are determined from forecasts of traffic volume.

#### [33 Level Corrections](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_8/lvl_d1755e148/lvl_3/lvl_33)

[1] The level correction K0 is equal to -8.

[2] The level correction K1 is calculated from the annual number of flight movements of jet aircraft Nj as follows:

K1 = 0 for Nj < 15 000

K1 = 10 x log (Nj/15 000) for Nj ≥ 15 000

[3] The level correction K2 is calculated from the annual number of flight movements of propeller aircraft Np as follows:

K2 = 0 for Np < 15 000

K2 = 10 x log (Np/15 000) for Np ≥ 15 000

### [1 Scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_9/lvl_d1755e159/lvl_1)

[1] The exposure limit values specified in Number 2 apply to the firing noise on military firing ranges and training grounds.

[2] In addition to the exposure limit values specified in Number 2, the exposure limit values specified in Annex 7 apply to the noise from civil firing on military firing ranges and training grounds, with the exception of firing by the police and border guards.

[3] Noise from repair workshops, maintenance workshops and similar operations and noise from traffic on military firing ranges and training grounds is considered equivalent to the noise from industrial and commercial installations (Annex 6 Number 1).

[4] Noise from helicopters on military firing ranges and training grounds is considered equivalent to the noise from heliports (Annex 5 Numbers 23 and 5).

### [3 Determination of the Rating Sound Level](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_9/lvl_d1755e159/lvl_3)

#### [31 Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_9/lvl_d1755e159/lvl_3/lvl_31)

The rating sound level Lr for the firing noise from military firing ranges and training grounds is calculated as follows from the sound levels LAE1 and LAE2 and the level corrections K1 and K2: 

Lr =10 **[.]****[]**log(10[0.][][1][.][L][][AE1][]+10[0.][][1][.][(L][][AE2][][+K1)] ) – 10 **[.]****[]**log(T) + K2

Where:

Lr Rating sound level for noise from military firing ranges and training grounds;

T Rating time in seconds = 52 weeks · 5 days · 12 hours · 60 minutes · 60 seconds;

LAE1 Sound exposure level of all the shooting events of a year which have taken place Mondays to Fridays between 07 and 19 hours;

LAE2 Sound exposure level of all the shooting events of a year which have taken place outside of the LAE1 timeframe;

K1 5

K2 15

#### [32 Determination of Shooting Operations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1987/338_338_338/en#annex_9/lvl_d1755e159/lvl_3/lvl_32)

[1] For existing military firing ranges and training grounds, the number of shots is determined from surveys carried out over three years.

[2] If, for existing military firing ranges and training grounds, no data on the number of shots is available or if the installations are new or have been modified, the number of shots is determined from forecasts of future use.
