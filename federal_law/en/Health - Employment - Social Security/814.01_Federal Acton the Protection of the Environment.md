[1] Any person who operates or intends to operate installations which, in exceptional circumstances, could seriously damage people or their natural environment must take the measures required to protect the population and the environment. In particular, suitable sites must be chosen, the required safety distances must be observed, technical safety measures must be taken and the monitoring of the installation and organisation of the alarm system must be ensured.

[2] The cantons coordinate the services responsible for disaster prevention and designate a reporting agency.

[3] The operator of the installation must immediately report any extraordinary event to the reporting agency.

[4] The Federal Council may prohibit by ordinance certain production methods and the keeping of certain stocks if there is no other way of protecting the population and the natural environment adequately.

## [Chapter 3](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_1/chap_3) [Environmental Impact Assessment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_1/chap_3)

[**Art. 10***a* Environmental impact assessment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_10_a) 

[1] Before taking any decision on the planning, construction or modification of installations, an authority must assess their impact on the environment at the earliest possible stage.

[2] The requirement of an environmental impact assessment applies to installations that could cause substantial pollution to environmental areas to the extent that it is probable that compliance with regulations on environmental protection can only be ensured through measures specific to the project or site.

[3] The Federal Council designates the types of installation that are subject to an environmental impact assessment; it may stipulate threshold values above which the assessment must be carried out. It reviews the types of installation and threshold values periodically and adjusts these if required.

[**Art. 10***b* Environmental impact report](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_10_b) 

[1] Any person who wishes to plan, construct or modify an installation that is subject to an environmental impact assessment must submit an environmental impact report to the competent authority. This forms the basis for the environmental impact assessment.

[2] The report contains all the information required to assess the project in accordance with the environmental protection regulations. It is drawn up in accordance with the guidelines issued by the environmental protection agencies and includes the following:


|    a. the existing condition;  
|    b. the project, including proposed measures for the protection of the environment and in the event of disaster, and an outline of the main alternatives, if need be studied by the applicant;  
|    c. the foreseeable residual environmental impact.

[3] In order to prepare for the report, a preliminary investigation is carried out. If the preliminary investigation conclusively ascertains the effects on the environment and the environmental protection measures required, the results of the preliminary investigation are deemed to be the report.

[4] The competent authority may request information or further clarification. It may call for expert reports; before doing so, the authority must allow interested parties the opportunity to state their opinions.

[**Art. 10***c* Assessment of the report](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_10_c) 

[1] The environmental protection agencies assess the preliminary investigation and the report and proposes the measures required to the competent decision-making authority. The Federal Council issues regulations on the time limits for the assessment.

[2] The competent authority must also consult the Federal Office for the Environment (the Federal Office) when the assessment concerns refineries, aluminium smelters, thermal power stations, or large cooling towers. The Federal Council may extend the duty to consult to cover other installations.

[**Art. 10***d* Public access to the report](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_10_d) 

[1] Any person may inspect the report and the results of the environmental impact assessment unless overriding public or private interests require secrecy.

[2] Trade and business secrecy must be preserved in all cases.

## [Chapter 4](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_1/chap_4) [Environmental Information](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_1/chap_4)

[**Art. 10***e* Environmental information and advice](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_10_e) 

[1] The authorities shall inform the public adequately about environmental protection and levels of environmental pollution; in particular:


|    a. they shall publish studies on environmental pollution and on the success of measures under this Act (Art. 44);  
|    b. they may, provided it is of general interest and having consulted those concerned, publish:  
|    1. the results of the conformity assessment of series-produced installations (Art. 40),  
|    2. the results of inspections of installations,  
|    3. the information under Article 46.



[2] Overriding private and public interests in confidentiality and manufacturing and business secrecy are reserved in every case.

[3] The environmental protection agencies shall advise the authorities and private individuals. They shall advise the public on environmentally sound behaviour and recommend measures to reduce environmental pollution.

[4] Environmental information must if possible be made available as open digital data records.

[**Art. 10***f* Environmental reports](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_10_f) 

The Federal Council shall assess the state of the environment in Switzerland at least every four years and shall submit a report on the results to the the Federal Assembly.

[**Art. 10***g* Freedom of information in the case of environmental information](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_10_g) 

[1] Any person has the right to inspect environmental information in official documents and information relating to energy regulations that relate the environment and to request information from the authorities about the content of these documents.

[2] In the case of federal authorities, this right is governed by the Freedom of Information Act of 17 December 2004 (FoIA). Article 23 FoIA applies only to documents that contain information under paragraph 1 relating to nuclear installations.

[3] The right to inspect also applies in the case of public corporations and private individuals who have been entrusted with enforcement duties but which do not have the power to issue rulings in accordance with Article 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act of 20 December 1968. In these cases, the competent enforcement authority shall issue rulings under Article 15 FoIA.

[4] In the case of cantonal authorities, the right is governed by cantonal law. If the cantons have not issued provisions on the access to documents, they shall apply the provisions of this Act and the FoIA *mutatis mutandis*.

# [Title 2 Pollution Control](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2)

## [Chapter 1 Air Pollution, Noise, Vibrations and Radiation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_1)

### [Section 1 Emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_1)

[**Art. 11** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_11) 

[1] Air pollution, noise, vibrations and radiation are limited by measures taken at their source (limitation of emissions).

[2] Irrespective of the existing environmental pollution, as a precautionary measure emissions are limited as much as technology and operating conditions allow, provided that this is economically acceptable.

[3] Emissions are limited more strictly if the effects are found or expected to be harmful or a nuisance, taking account of the existing level of environmental pollution.

[**Art. 12** Limitation of emissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_12) 

[1] Emissions are limited by issuing:


|    a. maximum emission values;  
|    b. regulations on construction and equipment;  
|    c. traffic or operating regulations;  
|    d. regulations on the heat insulation of buildings;  
|    e. regulations on thermal and motor fuels.

[2] Limits are prescribed by ordinance or, in cases where an ordinance makes no such provision, by rulings based directly on this Act.

### [Section 2 Ambient Pollution Levels](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_2)

[**Art. 13** Ambient limit values](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_13) 

[1] The Federal Council stipulates by ordinance the ambient limit values for assessing harmful effects or nuisances.

[2] In doing so, it also takes account of the effects of pollution levels on particularly sensitive groups such as children, the sick, the elderly and pregnant women.

[**Art. 14** Ambient limit values for air pollution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_14) 

The ambient limit values for air pollution must be set so that, in the light of current scientific knowledge and experience, ambient air pollution below these levels:


|    a. does not endanger people, animals or plants, their biological communities and habitats;  
|    b. does not seriously affect the well-being of the population;  
|    c. does not damage buildings;  
|    d. does not harm soil fertility, vegetation or waters.

[**Art. 15** Ambient limit values25 for noise and vibrations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_15) 

Ambient limit values for noise and vibrations must be set so that, in the light of current scientific knowledge and experience, ambient noise below these levels will not seriously disturb the well-being of the population.

### [Section 3 Improvements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_3)

[**Art. 16** Obligation to make improvements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_16) 

[1] Installations which do not comply with the provisions of this Act or with the environmental provisions of other federal acts must be improved.

[2] The Federal Council enacts provisions on installations, the extent of the measures to be taken, the time limits and procedures.

[3] Before ordering major improvement works, the authorities must request the operator of the installation to submit improvement proposals.

[4] In urgent cases, the authorities must order improvements as a precautionary measure. In an emergency, they may order the shutdown of the installation.

[**Art. 17** Concessions in individual cases](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_17) 

[1] The authorities must grant concessions if any improvement under Article 16, paragraph 2 is disproportionate in a particular case.

[2] The ambient limit values for air pollutants and the alarm values for ambient noise levels must not, however, be exceeded.

[**Art. 18** Structural alteration or extension of installations requiring improvement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_18) 

[1] Installations requiring improvement may be altered or extended only if they are improved at the same time.

[2] Concessions granted under Article 17 may be qualified or revoked.

### [Section 4 Additional Regulations for Protection against Noise and Vibrations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_4)


[**Art. 19** Alarm values](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_19) 

In order to assess the urgency of improvements (Art. 16 para. 2, and Art. 20), the Federal Council may set alarm values for ambient noise levels that are higher than the ambient limit values (Art. 15).

[**Art. 20** Soundproofing of existing buildings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_20) 

[1] If ambient noise levels in existing buildings near existing roads, airports, railway installations or other public or licensed fixed installations cannot be reduced to below the alarm values by measures taken at their source, the owners of the buildings concerned are required to protect areas used for long-stay accommodation by providing soundproof windows or by other similar building measures.

[2] The owners of fixed installations emitting noise bear the cost of the required soundproofing measures unless they can prove that when the planning application was made for the building in question:


|    a. the ambient limit values were already being exceeded; or  
|    b. the installation plans had already been made public.

[**Art. 21** Soundproofing of new buildings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_21) 

[1] Any person who wishes to construct a building for use as long-stay accommodation must take adequate soundproofing measures to protect it against internal and external noise and against vibration.

[2] The Federal Council determines the minimum protection required by ordinance.

[**Art. 22** Building permits in areas affected by noise](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_22) 

[1] Building permits for new buildings intended for use as long-stay accommodation are issued, subject to paragraph 2, only if the ambient limit values are not exceeded.

[2] If the ambient limit values are exceeded, building permits for new buildings intended for use as long-stay accommodation are issued only if the rooms are suitably arranged and any necessary additional soundproofing measures are taken.

[**Art. 23** Planning values](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_23) 

The Federal Council lays down maximum planning values for the planning of new building zones and for protection against noise from new fixed installations. These planning values are lower than the ambient limit values.

[**Art. 24** Standards for building zones](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_24) 

[1] New building zones intended for residential buildings or for other buildings intended as long-stay accommodation may be planned only in areas where ambient noise levels do not exceed the planning values or in areas where these values can be met by the application of planning, design or structural measures. The rezoning of building zones does not constitute the definition of new building zones.

[2] If the planning values are exceeded in an existing but as yet undeveloped building zone intended for residential buildings or other buildings intended as long-stay accommodation, it must be reallocated for a use that is less sensitive to noise, unless the planning values can be met in the greater part of the area by the application of planning, design or structural measures.

[**Art. 25** Construction of fixed installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_25) 

[1] New fixed installations may be constructed only if the ambient noise levels emitted from these installations alone do not exceed the planning values in the surrounding area; the planning authority may request a forecast of noise levels.

[2] Concessions may be granted if the installation is of overriding public benefit, in particular in relation to spatial planning, and compliance with the planning values would place a disproportionate burden on the project. However, subject to paragraph 3, the ambient limit values must not be exceeded in this case.

[3] If ambient limit values cannot be met during the construction of new roads, airports, railway installations or other public or licensed fixed installations by measures taken at source, buildings affected by the noise must be protected by soundproof windows or other similar building measures and the owner of the installation must bear the costs.

## [Chapter 2 Environmentally Hazardous Substances](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_2)

[**Art. 26** Self-regulation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_26) 

[1] The putting into circulation of substances for uses where, when handled correctly, they, their derivatives or waste may present a danger to the environment or indirectly endanger people is prohibited. 

[2] To this end, the manufacturer or importer is responsible for their own self-regulation.

[3] The Federal Council issues regulations on the nature, extent and supervision of the self-regulation.

[**Art. 27**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_27) [Information for recipients](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_27) 

[1] Any person who puts substances into circulation must:


|    a. inform recipients about their environment-related properties;  
|    b. provide recipients with instructions so that, when the substances are handled correctly, they do not present a danger to the environment or indirectly endanger people.

[2] The Federal Council issues regulations on the nature, content and extent of the information given to recipients.

[**Art. 28**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_28) [Environmentally safe handling](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_28) 

[1] Substances may only be handled in such a way that they, their derivatives or their waste cannot present a danger to the environment or indirectly endanger people.

[2] Instructions from manufacturers or importers must be complied with.

[**Art. 29** Federal Council regulations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_29) 

[1] The Federal Council may enact regulations on substances which, due to their properties, method of use or the quantities used, may present a danger to the environment or indirectly endanger people.

[2] These regulations relate in particular to:


|    a. substances that enter the environment due to their intended purpose, such as herbicides and pesticides, including wood preservatives and stock preservatives, fertilisers, growth regulators, road salts and propellants;  
|    b. substances or their derivatives that can accumulate in the environment, such as chlorinated organic compounds and heavy metals.

## [Chapter 3](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_3) [Handling Organisms](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_3)

[**Art. 29***a* Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_29_a) 

[1] Organisms must be handled in such a way that they, their metabolic products or wastes:


|    a. cannot endanger the environment or people;  
|    b. do not harm biological diversity or its sustainable use.

[2] The handling of genetically modified organisms is governed by the Gene Technology Act of 21 March 2003.

[3] Regulations in other federal acts that serve to protect people’s health against immediate danger from organisms are reserved.

[**Art. 29***b* Activities in contained systems](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_29_b) 

[1] Any person who handles pathogenic organisms that he may not release for experimental purposes (Art. 29*c*) or put into circulation for uses in the environment (Art. 29*d*) must take all the containment measures required, in particular due to the risk that the organisms represent to the environment and to people.

[2] The Federal Council shall introduce a notification or authorisation obligation for handling of pathogenic organisms.

[3] For certain pathogenic organisms and activities, the Federal Council may provide for a simplification of the notification or authorisation obligation or for exemptions if, in the light of current scientific knowledge or experience, an infringement of the principles contained in Article 29*a* is excluded.

[**Art. 29***c* Experimental releases](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_29_c) 

[1] Any person who wishes for experimental purposes to release pathogenic organisms that may not be put into circulation for uses in the environment (Art. 29*d*) requires the authorisation of the Confederation.

[2] The Federal Council determines the requirements and the procedure. It regulates in particular:


|    a. the consultation with specialists;  
|    b. the financial guarantee for measures by which any effects causing damage or nuisance may be detected, averted or eliminated;  
|    c. the information provided to the general public.

[3] For certain pathogenic organisms, it may provide for a simplification of the authorisation obligation or for exemptions if, in the light of current scientific knowledge or experience, an infringement of the principles contained in Article 29*a* is excluded.

[**Art. 29***d* Putting into circulation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_29_d) 

[1] Organisms may not be put into circulation for uses in which the principles contained in Article 29*a* are infringed despite their being handled in accordance with the relevant provisions.

[2] The manufacturer or importer carries out its own self-regulation for this purpose. The Federal Council enacts regulations on the nature, extent and supervision of the self-regulation.

[3] Pathogenic organisms may be put into circulation for uses in the environment only with the authorisation of the Confederation.

[4] The Federal Council determines the requirements and the procedure and regulates the information provided to the general public. For certain pathogenic organisms, it may provide for a simplification of the authorisation obligation or for exemptions if, in the light of current scientific knowledge or experience, an infringement of principles contained in Article 29*a* is excluded.

[**Art. 29***d*[bis]](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_29_d_bis) [Objection procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_29_d_bis) 

[1] Applications for authorisations under Articles 29*c* paragraph 1, 29*d* paragraph 3 and 29*f* paragraph 2 letter b shall be published by the issuing authority in the Federal Gazette and made available for public inspection for 30 days.

[2] Any person who is a party in accordance with the Federal Act of 20 December 1968 on Administrative Procedure may file an objection with the issuing authority during the public inspection period. Persons who fail to file an objection are excluded from any further proceedings.

[**Art. 29***e* Information to recipients](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_29_e) 

[1] Any person who puts organisms into circulation must:


|    a. inform recipients of properties of the organisms that are of significance to the application of principles contained in Article 29*a*;  
|    b. provide recipients with instructions so that handling according to the provisions will not result in any breach of the principles contained in Article 29*a*.

[2] Instructions from manufacturers and importers must be complied with.

[**Art. 29***f* Further Federal Council regulations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_29_f) 

[1] The Federal Council shall issue further regulations on handling of organisms, their metabolic products and wastes if, due to their properties, the form of their use or the quantity used, the principles contained in Article 29*a* may be breached.

[2] It may in particular:


|    a. regulate the transport and the import, export and transit of the organisms;  
|    b. declare handling certain organisms to be subject to authorisation, or restrict or prohibit such handling;  
|    c. stipulate measures to combat certain organisms or to prevent their occurrence;

## [Chapter 4](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_4) [Waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_4)

### [Section 1 Avoidance and Disposal of Waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_4/sec_1)

[**Art. 30** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_30) 

[1] The production of waste should be avoided wherever possible.

[2] Waste must be recovered wherever possible.

[3] Waste must be disposed of in an environmentally compatible way and, insofar as this is possible and reasonable, within Switzerland.

[**Art. 30***a* Avoidance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_30_a) 

The Federal Council may:


|    a. prohibit placing products intended for once-only, short-term use on the market if the benefits of such use do not justify the harm to the environment that they cause;  
|    b. prohibit the use of substances and organisms that considerably hamper disposal or the disposal of which may represent a danger to the environment;  
|    c. require manufacturers to avoid production waste where there is no known environmentally compatible process for its disposal.

[**Art. 30***b* Collection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_30_b) 

[1] The Federal Council may require certain types of waste that are suitable for recovery or that need special treatment to be handed over separately for disposal.

[2] It may require those who put products into circulation that are suitable for recovery or need special treatment:


|    a. to accept the return such products back after use;  
|    b. to charge a minimum deposit and to refund this when the product is returned.

[3] It may arrange for the establishment of a deposit compensation fund and specifically require:


|    a. those who put products into circulation on which deposits are paid to pay any surplus from the deposit charges into the compensation fund;  
|    b. the surplus to be used to cover losses from refunding deposits and to encourage the return of products on which deposits are paid.

[**Art. 30***c* Treatment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_30_c) 

[1] Waste intended for deposit in a landfill must be treated so that it contains as little organic bound carbon as possible and is as insoluble as possible in water.

[2] Waste must not be burned other than in incineration plants; the foregoing does not apply to the burning of natural forest, field and garden waste provided that this causes no excessive ambient pollution levels.

[3] The Federal Council may issue further regulations on treatment for specific types of waste.

[**Art. 30***d* Recovery](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_30_d) 

The Federal Council may:


|    a. require certain types of waste to be recovered if this is economically feasible and harms the environment less than other forms of disposal and the manufacture of new products;  
|    b. restrict the use of substances and products for certain purposes if this will promote the sale of equivalent products made from recovered waste without significant loss of quality or additional cost.

[**Art. 30***e* Depositing in landfills](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_30_e) 

[1] Waste may be deposited only in landfills.

[2] Any person wishing to set up or operate a landfill requires authorisation from the relevant canton; this will be issued only if he furnishes proof that the site is necessary. The types of waste that may be deposited on the site are specified in the authorisation.

[**Art. 30***f* Handling of special waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_30_f) 

[1] The Federal Council enacts regulations on handling of waste whose environmentally compatible disposal requires special measures (special waste). It also regulates the import, export and transit of such waste, paying special attention to the interests of regional cross-border cooperation as well as to the environmental impact of disposal facilities in Switzerland and abroad. It may also enact regulations for companies which from within Switzerland organise or are involved in handling of special waste.

[2] It requires, in particular, that special waste:


|    a. must be marked as such for transfer within Switzerland as well as for import, export and transit;  
|    b. may be handed over in Switzerland only to companies with authorisation in terms of letter d;  
|    c. may be exported only with authorisation from the Federal Office;  
|    d. may be accepted or imported only by companies with authorisation from the canton.

[3] These authorisations are granted if environmentally compatible disposal is guaranteed.

[4] ...

[**Art. 30***g* Handling of other forms of waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_30_g) 

[1] The Federal Council may enact regulations in accordance with Article 30*f* paragraphs 1 and 2 on handling of other forms of waste, if environmentally compatible disposal is not guaranteed.

[2] ...

[**Art. 30***h* Waste disposal facilities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_30_h) 

[1] The Federal Council enacts technical and organisational regulations on waste disposal facilities.

[2] The authority may set a time limit for the operation of waste disposal facilities.

### [Section 2 Waste Management and the Disposal Obligation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_4/sec_2)

[**Art. 31** Waste management](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_31) 

[1] The cantons draw up a waste management plan. In particular, they establish their requirements for waste disposal facilities, avoid over-capacity, and decide on the sites for the waste disposal facilities.

[2] They notify the Confederation of their waste management plan.

[**Art. 31***a* Cooperation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_31_a) 

[1] The cantons cooperate on waste management and disposal. They avoid over-capacity in waste disposal facilities.

[2] If they cannot agree, they must submit proposed solutions to the Confederation. If mediation by the Confederation does not lead to agreement, the Federal Council may order the cantons:


|    a. to determine the areas from which waste must be delivered to the installations for treatment, recovery or deposit in landfills (catchment areas);  
|    b. to determine sites for waste disposal facilities;  
|    c. to make suitable waste disposal facilities available to other cantons; where necessary, it determines how costs are to be shared.

[**Art. 31***b* Disposal of municipal waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_31_b) 

[1] Municipal waste, waste from the maintenance of public roads and from public waste water treatment as well as waste generated by persons unknown or unable to pay is disposed of by the cantons. For waste that must be recovered by the holder or the return of which must be accepted by third parties in accordance with special federal regulations, the duty of disposal is governed by Article 31*c*.

[2] The cantons determine the catchment areas for these forms of waste and ensure that the waste disposal facilities are operated economically.

[3] The holder must hand over the waste for collection by the services organised by the cantons or deliver it to the collection points determined by the cantons.

[**Art. 31***c* Disposal of other waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_31_c) 

[1] Any other form of waste must be disposed of by its holder. He may instruct third parties to dispose of it.

[2] Where necessary, the cantons may facilitate disposal of this waste by appropriate means. They may, in particular, determine catchment areas.

[3] If the disposal of this waste requires only a few catchment areas in the whole of Switzerland, the Federal Council may determine them.

### [Section 3 Financing of Disposal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_4/sec_3)

[**Art. 32** Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32) 

[1] The holder of the waste bears the cost of its disposal, except for waste for which the Federal Council regulates the bearing of the cost in some other way.

[2] If the holder cannot be identified or if he cannot fulfil his obligation under paragraph 1 because he is unable to pay, the cantons bear the cost of disposal.

[**Art. 32***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_a) [Financing for municipal waste](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_a) 

[1] The cantons ensure that the cost of disposing of municipal waste, insofar as it is their responsibility, is passed on to those responsible for producing the waste through fees or other charges. In organising the charges, the following factors in particular are taken into account:


|    a. the nature and the quantity of the waste handed over;  
|    b. the costs of the construction, operation and maintenance of the waste disposal facilities;  
|    c. the depreciation required to preserve the value of such installations;  
|    d. the interest;  
|    e. the planned investment requirements for maintenance, improvements and replacements, for adaptation to statutory requirements and operational optimisation.

[2] If imposing cost-covering charges on those responsible for the waste jeopardises the environmentally sustainable disposal of municipal waste, disposal may be financed differently to the extent required.

[3] The operators of the waste disposal facilities must form the required financial reserves.

[4] The principles for the calculation of the charges must be made available to the public.

[**Art. 32***a*[bis]](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_a_bis) [Prepaid disposal fee](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_a_bis) 

[1] The Federal Council may require manufacturers and importers who put products into circulation which, after use by a large number of holders, become waste and have to be given special treatment or are suitable for recovery to pay a prepaid disposal fee to a private organisation appointed and supervised by the Confederation. This fee is used to finance the disposal of the waste by private individuals or public corporations.

[2] The Federal Council sets the minimum and maximum amount of the fee on the basis of the cost of disposal. Within this framework, the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications determines the level of the fee.

[3] The Federal Council lays down the methods of collecting and using the fee. It may, in particular, require that persons putting products into circulation inform customers in an appropriate manner of the level of the fee.

[**Art. 32***b* Financial guarantee for landfills](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_b) 

[1] Any person who operates or wishes to operate a landfill must guarantee that the costs of closure, after-care and remediation are covered by making reserves, by taking out insurance or in some other way.

[2] If the operator of the landfill is himself the guarantor, he must notify the authority annually of the amount of the guarantee.

[3] If a third party acts as guarantor, he must notify the authority of the existence, suspension and termination of the guarantee. The Federal Council may provide that the guarantee must not be suspended or terminated until 60 days after receipt of the notification.

[4] The Federal Council may enact regulations on the guarantee. In particular, it may:


|    a. determine its scope and duration or leave this to the authority to decide on a case-to-case basis;  
|    b. make provision for the land on which the landfill is situated to become the property of the canton when the site is closed, and enact regulations concerning any compensation.

[**Art. 32***b*[bis]](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_b_bis) [Financing in the case of excavation material from polluted sites](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_b_bis) 

[1] If the proprietor of land removes material from a polluted site that does not require to be disposed of in terms of remediation under Article 32*c*, he may normally claim reimbursement of two thirds of additional costs of the investigation and disposal of the material from the persons responsible for the pollution and the previous proprietors of the site if:


|    a. the persons responsible have not paid any compensation for the pollution or the previous proprietors did not grant any reduction of the price on the sale of the land due to the pollution;  
|    b. the removal of the material is required for the construction or alteration of buildings; and   
|    c. the proprietor acquired the property between 1 July 1972 and 1 July 1997.

[2] The claim may be filed in the civil court at the location of the property. The relevant civil procedure code applies.

[3] Claims under paragraph 1 may be filed at the latest by 1 November 2021.

### [Section 4](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_4/sec_4) [Remediation of Polluted Sites](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_4/sec_4)

[**Art. 32***c* Obligation to remediate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_c) 

[1] The cantons ensure that landfills and other sites polluted by waste (polluted sites) are remediated if such sites lead to harmful effects or nuisances or if there is a concrete risk that such effects may arise. The Federal Council may enact regulations about the need for remediation and on the objectives and urgency of remediation work.

[2] The cantons draw up a register of polluted sites that is accessible to the public.

[3] They may carry out the investigation, monitoring and remediation of polluted sites themselves or instruct third parties to do so if:


|    a. this is required to avert imminent effects;  
|    b. the person liable is unable to arrange for the measures to be carried out; or  
|    c. the person liable fails to act despite being reminded and allowed time to do so.

[**Art. 32***d* Responsibility for costs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_d) 

[1] The person responsible bears the costs of the measures required to investigate, monitor and remediate polluted sites.

[2] If two or more persons are responsible, they bear the costs according to their shares of the responsibility. The first to bear the costs is the person who caused the measures to be needed through his conduct. Any person who is responsible simply as the proprietor of the site does not bear any costs if, by exercising the required care, he could not have had any knowledge of the pollution.

[3] The public authority concerned bears the share of the costs of any person responsible who cannot be identified or is unable to pay.

[4] The authority issues a ruling on the allocation of costs if any person responsible so requests or if the authority is carrying out the measures itself.

[5] If an investigation of a site entered in the register (Art. 32*c* para. 2) or for which an entry is planned reveals that the site is not polluted, the public authority concerned bears the costs of the investigative measures required.

[**Art. 32***d*[bis]](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_d_bis) [Security for costs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_d_bis) 

[1] The authority may request the person responsible to provide appropriate security to cover his probable share of the costs of investigation, monitoring and remediation where a polluted site is expected to cause harmful effects or nuisances.

[2] The amount of the security is fixed in particular on the basis of the extent, nature and intensity of the pollution. It is adjusted if justified on the basis of improved knowledge of the situation.

[3] The sale or division of immovable property on which a site is located that is entered in the register of polluted sites requires the authority's authorisation. Authorisation is granted if:


|    a. no harmful effects or nuisances are expected from the site;  
|    b. security is provided for the costs of the expected measures; or  
|    c. there is an overriding public interest in the sale or in the division.

[4] The cantonal authority may have the entry in the register of polluted sites noted in the land register entry for the property in question.

[**Art. 32***e* Charge to finance measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_32_e) 

[1] The Federal Council may require that a charge be paid to the Confederation:


|    a. by the operator of a landfill on the deposit of waste in the landfill;  
|    b. by any person who exports waste for deposit in a landfill, on the export of waste.

[1bis] In the case of landfills in which only non-contaminated waste is deposited, a charge may only be required if it is necessary in order to fund the recovery of such waste.

[2] The Federal Council determines the rates of the charge, taking special account of the expected costs and the various types of landfill. The maximum rates of the charge are as follows:


|    a. for waste deposited in Switzerland:  
|    1. in the case of landfills for non-contaminated or lightly contaminated waste: CHF 8/t,  
|    2. in the case of other landfills: CHF 25/t;


|    b. for waste deposited abroad:  
|    1. in the case of underground landfills; CHF 30/t,  
|    2. in the case of other landfills: as much as it would cost to deposit the waste in a landfill in Switzerland.



[2bis] The Federal Council may adjust the rate of the charge under paragraph 2 in line with Swiss Consumer Price Index.

[3] The Confederation uses the income from the charges exclusively to pay the costs of the following measures:


|    a. the provision of a register of polluted sites, provided their proprietors have been given the opportunity by 1 November 2007 to state their opinion on inclusion in the register;  
|    b. the investigation, monitoring and remediation of polluted sites in which no waste has been deposited since 1 February 2001 if:  
|    1. the person responsible cannot be identified or is unable to pay, or  
|    2. a significant proportion of the waste deposited on the site is municipal waste;


|    c. the investigation, monitoring and remediation of polluted sites at shooting ranges that do not serve a predominantly commercial purpose if:   
|    1. on sites in groundwater protection zones, no further waste has been deposited after 31 December 2012,  
|    2. on other sites, no further waste has been deposited after 31 December 2020 or only the waste from historical shooting events or field shooting events that are held no more than once per year and that had already been held regularly at the same location before 31 December 2020;


|    c[bis]. adequate protection measures, such as the use of butts, are taken at historical shooting events or field shooting events that are held no more than once per year and that had already been held regularly at the same location before 31 December 2020;  
|    d. the investigation of sites that are not found to be polluted (Art. 32*d* para. 5).

[4] The payments are made only if the measures taken are environmentally compatible and cost-effective and correspond to the state of the art. They are paid to the cantons in accordance with the expenditure incurred and amount to:


|    a. for payments in accordance with paragraph 3 letter a, a flat-rate payment of 500 francs per site;  
|    b. for payments in accordance with paragraph 3 letter b:  
|    1. 40 per cent of the chargeable costs if no waste has been deposited at the site since 1 February 1996,  
|    2. 30 per cent of the chargeable costs if waste was deposited at the site after 1 February 1996 but no later than 31 January 2001.


|    c. for payments in accordance with paragraph 3 letter c:  
|    1. in the case of 300m shooting ranges, a flat-rate payment of 8000 francs per target,  
|    2. in the case of other shooting ranges, 40 per cent of the chargeable costs;


|    d. for payments in accordance with paragraph 3 letter d, 40 per cent of the chargeable costs.

[5] The Federal Council issues regulations on the procedure for collecting the charges and making the payments as well as on the chargeable costs.

[6] Provision may be made under cantonal law for cantonal charges to finance the investigation, monitoring and remediation of polluted sites.

## [Chapter 5](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_5) [Soil Pollution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_5)

[**Art. 33** Measures against soil pollution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_33) 

[1] For the long-term preservation of soil fertility, measures against chemical and biological soil pollution must be laid down in the implementing regulations to the Federal Act on the Protection of Water of 24 January 1991, on disaster management, on air pollution control, on environmentally hazardous substances and organisms, on waste and on incentive taxes.

[2] The soil may be physically affected only to the extent that its fertility is not durably degraded; this does not apply to land used for building. The Federal Council may issue regulations or recommendations on measures against physical impacts such as erosion or compaction.

[**Art. 34** Stricter measures against soil pollution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_34) 

[1] If soil fertility in certain areas is no longer guaranteed in the long term, the cantons must, in agreement with the Confederation, introduce to the required extent stricter regulations on requirements for sewage infiltration, limitation of emissions for installations, the use of substances and organisms or physical impacts on soil.

[2] If the soil pollution endangers humans, animals or plants, the cantons must restrict the use of the soil to the required extent.

[3] If the soil is intended for horticultural, agricultural or forestry use and it is impossible to cultivate it in a normal way in that location without endangering humans, animals or plants, the cantons must enact measures to reduce the soil pollution at least to such an extent that non-hazardous cultivation is possible.

[**Art. 35** Guide values and soil remediation values](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_35) 

[1] The Federal Council may set guide values and soil remediation values for assessing pollution of the soil.

[2] The guide values indicate the pollution level above which, in the light of current scientific knowledge or experience, soil fertility is no longer guaranteed in the long term.

[3] The soil remediation values indicate the pollution level above which, in the light of current scientific knowledge or experience, certain uses are not possible without endangering humans, animals or plants.

## [Chapter 6](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_6) [Incentive Taxes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_2/chap_6)

[**Art. 35***a* Volatile organic compounds](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_35_a) 

[1] Any person who imports volatile organic compounds or any person who, as a manufacturer, puts such compounds into circulation or uses them himself must pay an incentive tax to the Confederation.

[2] The import of such compounds in paints and varnishes is also subject to the tax. The Federal Council may make the import of such compounds in other mixtures or articles subject to the tax if the quantities of these compounds are such as to pollute the environment to a considerable extent or if these compounds account for a significant proportion of the cost of the product.

[3] Volatile organic compounds are exempt from the tax if:


|    a. they are used as motor or thermal fuels;  
|    b. they are in transit or being exported;  
|    c. they are used or treated in such a way that they are not released into the environment.

[4] The Federal Council may grant tax relief to the extent of the additional costs incurred for volatile organic compounds which are so used or treated that their emissions are reduced to substantially below the legal requirements.

[5] The Federal Council may exempt volatile organic compounds that are not environmentally hazardous from the tax.

[6] The tax rate amounts to a maximum of five francs per kilogram of volatile organic compounds, plus a surcharge to take account of inflation from the date on which this provision comes into force.

[7] The Federal Council sets the rate of the tax with reference to air quality objectives, taking special account of:


|    a. the pollution that volatile organic compounds cause to the environment;  
|    b. the danger these compounds represent to the environment;  
|    c. the cost of measures that can limit the effects of these compounds;  
|    d. the price of these substances and the price of alternative substances which are less harmful to the environment.

### [Section 2 Organisations’ Right of Appeal against Rulings on Installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_3/chap_3/sec_2)


[**Art. 55**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_55) [Organisations with the right to appeal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_55) 

[1] Environmental protection organisations have the right of appeal against rulings of the cantonal or federal authorities on the planning, construction or modification of installations for which an environmental impact assessment in terms of Article 10*a* is required, subject to the following requirements:


|    a. the organisation is active in Switzerland on a national basis;  
|    b. it pursues non-profit making objects; any commercial activities must serve to achieve the non-profit making objects.

[2] The right of appeal is available to organisations only for complaints in legal fields that have formed their objects in terms of their articles for a minimum of ten years.

[3] The Federal Council designates the organisations that have the right to appeal.

[4] The supreme executive body of the organisation is responsible for filing the appeal.

[5] The organisations may authorise their legally independent cantonal and supra-cantonal subsidiary organisations to file objections and on a case-by-case basis to file appeals that relate to their local field of activity.

[**Art. 55***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_55_a) [Notification of the ruling](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_55_a) 

[1] The authority notifies the organisations of its ruling under Article 55 paragraph 1 by written notice or by publication in the Official Federal Gazette or in the cantonal organ of publication.

[2] If federal or cantonal law provides for an objection procedure, applications must also be published in accordance with paragraph 1.

[1] Organisations that have not sought legal recourse may only participate in subsequent proceedings as a party if they are prejudiced by a change in the ruling. For compulsory purchases, the Federal Act of 20 June 1930 on Compulsory Purchase applies.

[2] If an organisation has not participated in objection proceedings under federal or cantonal law, it may no longer file an appeal.

[3] If an organisation has not filed a permitted complaint against a land use plan that has the character of a ruling or if the complaint has been rejected with full legal effect, the organisation may no longer file the same complaints in subsequent proceedings.

[4] Paragraphs 2 and 3 also apply to objections and appeals under cantonal law against land use plans.

[1] If an applicant and organisation enter into an agreement on obligations that relate to public law matters, these agreements are deemed exclusively to be joint applications to the authority. The authority takes account of the result in its ruling or in its decision. It does not take account of the result if it is defective in terms of Article 49 of the Federal Act of 20 December 1968 on Administrative Procedure.

[2] Agreements between applicants and organisations on financial or other benefits are not permitted if they are intended for:


|    a. the enforcement of public law obligations, and in particular requirements imposed by authorities;  
|    b. measures that are not provided for under public law or which have no connection with the project;

# [Title 4](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_4) [Liability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#tit_4)

[**Art. 59***a* General provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_59_a)

[1] The operator of an establishment or an installation that represents a special threat to the environment is liable for the loss or damage arising from effects that occur when this threat becomes reality. In the case of loss or damage that arises from the handling of pathogenic organisms, Article 59*a*[bis] applies.

[2] As a rule, the following establishments and installations are regarded as representing a special threat to the environment:


|    a. those that the Federal Council makes subject to the implementing provisions in terms of Article 10 on the basis of the substances or organisms used or the waste produced;  
|    b. those that are used for waste disposal;  
|    c. those in which liquids which may pollute water are handled;  
|    d. those in which substances are present for which the Federal Council has introduced a licensing requirement or other special regulations to protect the environment.

[3] Any person who proves that the loss or damage was caused by force majeure or by gross negligence on the part of the injured party or of a third party is relieved of liability.

[4] Articles 42–47 and 49–53 of the Code of Obligations apply.

[5] The reservation in Article 3 applies to liability provisions in other federal acts.

[6] The Confederation, cantons and communes may also be held liable in accordance with paragraphs 1–5.

[**Art. 59***a*[bis]](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_59_a_bis) [Pathogenic organisms](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_59_a_bis) 

[1] Persons subject to an authorisation or notification obligation who handle pathogenic organisms in a contained system, release such organisms for experimental purposes or put them into circulation without authorisation are liable for any loss or damage that arises from such conduct.

[2] The person required to obtain authorisation is exclusively liable for any loss or damage occasioned to an agricultural or forestry establishment or customers of products from such establishments by pathogenic organisms that are authorised to be put into circulation if the organisms:


|    a. are contained in auxiliary agents used in agriculture or forestry; or  
|    b. originate from such auxiliary agents.

[3] In the case of liability under paragraph 2, recourse is reserved against persons who have handled such organisms improperly or have otherwise contributed to causing or aggravating the loss or damage.

[4] If loss or damage is caused by any other pathogenic organisms that are authorised to be put into circulation, the person required to obtain authorisation is liable if the organisms are defective. He is also liable for any defect that he was unable to detect according to the standards of science and technology at the time that the organism was put into circulation.

[5] Pathogenic organisms are defective if they do not offer the level of safety that anyone is entitled to expect taking account of all the circumstances; the following must be taken into account in particular:


|    a. the way in which they are presented to the public;  
|    b. the use that may reasonably be expected;  
|    c. the time at which they were put into circulation.

[6] A product containing pathogenic organisms is not defective simply because an improved product has subsequently been put into circulation.

[7] The loss or damage must be due to the pathogenicity of the organisms.

[8] The burden of proving a causal connection lies with the person claiming damages. If such proof cannot be provided with certainty or if the person subject to the burden cannot reasonably be expected to present the required evidence, the court may satisfy itself on the balance of probability. The court may also order that the facts of the case be established *ex officio*.

[9] The person required to obtain authorisation or file a report must also reimburse the costs of the required and appropriate measures that have been taken to reconstitute elements of the environment that have been destroyed or damaged or to replace such elements with their equivalents. If the destroyed or damaged elements of the environment are not the subject of a property right or if the person entitled does not take the measures required in the circumstances, the right to damages becomes that of the public authority concerned.

[10] Any person who proves that the loss or damage was caused by force majeure or by gross negligence on the part of the injured party or of a third party is relieved of liability.

[11] Articles 42–47 and 49–53 of the Code of Obligations apply.

[12] The Confederation, cantons and communes may also be held liable in accordance with paragraphs 1–11.

[**Art. 59***b* Guarantee](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_59_b) 

For the protection of injured parties, the Federal Council may:


|    a. require that the operators of certain establishments or installations as well as the persons required to obtain authorisation or file a report that handle pathogenic organisms to provide a guarantee for their potential liability through insurance or in another manner;  
|    b. determine the extent and the duration of this guarantee or leave this to the authority to decide on a case-by-case basis;  
|    c. require those providing a guarantee for liability to notify the enforcement authority of the existence, suspension and termination of the guarantee;  
|    d. provide that the guarantee must not be suspended or terminated until 60 days after receipt of the notification;  
|    e. provide that land on which a waste disposal site is situated becomes the property of the canton when the site is closed, and enact regulations concerning any compensation.

[**Art. 59***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_59_c) [Prescription](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_59_c) 

[1] The right to damages prescribes in accordance with Article 60 of the Code of Obligations.

[2] If the loss or damage occurs due to the handling of pathogenic organisms, the right to damages prescribes three years after the injured person obtains knowledge of the loss or damage and of the identity of the person liable, but at the latest 30 years after:


|    a. the event that caused the loss or damage occurred in the establishment or in the installation or came to an end; or  
|    b. the pathogenic organisms were put into circulation.

[**Art. 59***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_59_d) [Prescription of the right of recourse](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1984/1122_1122_1122/en#art_59_d)
