For this purpose, the notifier may be requested to provide additional information and, if necessary, to carry out further tests.

[2] A risk assessment shall be required for:


|    a. new substances (Art. 9);  
|    b. substances and preparations subject to mandatory authorisation (Art. 10 and 11);
