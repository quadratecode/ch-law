[1] «Radioactive waste» means radioactive substances or radioactively contaminated materials which are not reused.

[2] Radioactive substances are to be handled in such a way that as little radioactive waste as possible is generated.

[3] Radioactive waste arising in Switzerland must, as a general rule, be disposed of in this country. By way of exception, an export licence may be granted for the disposal of radioactive waste if:


|    a. the recipient country has consented to the import of the radioactive waste for disposal in an international agreement;  
|    b. an appropriate nuclear facility meeting international standards of science and technology is available in the recipient country;  
|    c. transit has been approved by the transit countries;  
|    d. the sender has entered into a binding agreement with the recipient of the radioactive waste, with the approval of the authority designated by the Federal Council, to the effect that the sender will take back the waste if necessary.

[4] By way of exception, an import licence may be granted for radioactive waste that does not originate in Switzerland but is to be disposed of in this country if:


|    a. Switzerland has consented to the import of the radioactive waste for disposal in an international agreement;  
|    b. an appropriate nuclear facility meeting international standards of science and technology is available in Switzerland;  
|    c. transit has been approved by the transit countries;  
|    d. the recipient has entered into a binding agreement with the sender of the radioactive waste, with the approval of the country of origin, to the effect that the sender will take back the waste if necessary.

[1] On-site, radioactive waste must be handled and stored in such a way as to minimize releases of radioactive substances to the environment.

[2] The Federal Council shall specify the conditions under which low-level radioactive waste may be discharged to the environment.

[3] Radioactive waste that is not to be discharged to the environment must be suitably retained or securely contained, possibly in solidified form, collected and stored at a site approved by the supervisory authority while awaiting surrender or export.

[**Art. 27** Surrender](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1994/1933_1933_1933/en#art_27)

[1] Anyone who produces radioactive waste not arising as a result of the use of nuclear energy is required to surrender it to a centre designated by the competent authority.

[2] The waste producer must bear the costs of disposal.

[3] The Federal Council shall regulate the treatment of waste on-site and its surrender.

[4] If immediate surrender or disposal is not possible, or not appropriate for reasons of radiological protection, the waste must be placed in supervised interim storage.
