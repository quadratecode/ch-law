[**Art. 6**  Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_6) 

[1]It is prohibited to introduce into a body of water, either directly or indirectly any substances which may pollute it; the infiltration of such substances is also prohibited.

[2]It is also prohibited to store or spread such substances outside a body of water if there is a genuine risk of water pollution.

[**Art. 7** Disposal of waste water](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_7) 

[1]Polluted waste water must be treated. It may only be discharged or infiltrated into a body of water with the authorisation of the cantonal authority.

[2]Non-polluted waste water must be discharged by infiltration according to the instructions of the cantonal authority. If local conditions do not permit this, such non-polluted water may be discharged into surface waters; in this case retention measures must be taken if possible so as to ensure a steady discharge in the event of high inflow. The discharge of water that is not shown on a communal drainage plan approved by the canton requires the consent of the cantonal authority.

[3] The cantons shall arrange the drawing up of communal and, if required, regional drainage plans.

[**Art. 8**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_8)

[**Art. 9** Federal Council regulations on the discharge and infiltration of substances](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_9) 

[1]The Federal Council shall specify the water quality requirements for surface and underground waters.

[2]It shall enact regulations on:


|    a. the discharge of waste water into bodies of water;  
|    b. the infiltration of waste water;  
|    c. substances which may according to the method of their use enter into water and which, by reason of their properties or the quantities used, risk polluting waters or impairing the operation of waste water treatment plants.

### [Section 2 Treatment of Waste Water and Use of Farm Manure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_2)

[1]The cantons shall be responsible for the construction of public sewers and central plants for the treatment of polluted waste water:


|    a. from building zones;  
|    b. from existing groups of buildings outside building zones for which the special procedures for the disposal of waste water (Art. 13) provide insufficient protection for waters or are not economically viable.

[1bis] They shall ensure that these plants are operated economically.

[2]In isolated or sparsely inhabited regions, polluted waste water must be treated by systems other than central waste water treatment plants provided that the protection of surface and underground waters is guaranteed.

[3]If private sewers also serve the public interest, their status is equal to that of public sewers.

[4] ...

[**Art. 11** Duty to connect to sewers and to accept polluted waste water](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_11) 

[1]Polluted waste water which originates in an area served by public sewers shall be discharged into such sewers.

[2]The areas served by public sewers shall include:


|    a. building zones;  
|    b. other zones as soon as they are connected to the public sewers (Art. 10 para. 1, let. b);  
|    c. other zones where connection to the public sewers is expedient and reasonable.

[3]The person responsible for the sewers is obliged to accept waste water and convey it to the appropriate central waste water treatment plant.

[**Art. 12** Special cases in areas covered by public sewers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_12) 

[1]Those responsible for waste water which does not meet the requirements laid down for discharge into the drainage system must subject such waste water to pre-treatment. Such pre-treatment shall be regulated by the cantons.

[2]The cantonal authorities shall decide on the appropriate way to dispose of waste water which is not suited for treatment by a central water treatment plant.

[3]Non-polluted waste water with permanent flow shall not be passed through a central waste water treatment plant either directly or indirectly. The cantonal authorities may authorise exceptions to this rule.

[4]In a farm comprising a substantial stock of cattle or pigs, domestic waste water may be used agriculturally together with the liquid manure (Art. 14) provided that:


|    a. residential or industrial buildings and their adjoining land are situated in an area classified as an agricultural zone or the communal authority is taking the necessary measures, particularly in the field of area planning, to classify the buildings and their adjoining land in an agricultural zone;  
|    b. storage capacity is sufficient for domestic waste water too and the waste water is used on land which is either owned or leased by the farm in question.

[5]If the residential or industrial buildings and their adjoining land in accordance with Art. 4 are not allocated to an agricultural zone within five years, domestic waste water must be discharged into the public sewers.

[**Art. 13** Special procedures for the disposal of waste water](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_13) 

[1]Outside areas covered by public sewers, waste water shall be disposed of by state-of-the art methods.

[2]The cantons shall ensure that water quality requirements are respected.

[**Art. 14** Animal husbandry farms](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_14) 

[1]All animal husbandry farms must attempt to balance their use of manure.

[2]Farm manure shall be used in agriculture and horticulture in an environmentally compatible way and according to the state-of-the-art.

[3]The farm must have storage facilities with a capacity for at least three months. However, the cantonal authorities may require a higher storage capacity for establishments situated in mountain areas or in areas with unfavourable climatic or special crop growing conditions. Lower storage capacities may also be authorised for buildings which are occupied by livestock for only short periods of time.

[4]A maximum of three livestock units of manure may be spread on 1 ha of agricultural land. If part of the farm manure is used outside the normal local farming area, the number of animals kept must be such that at least half the manure produced by the farm may be used on the agricultural land owned or leased.

[5]Farms that provide manure must record each delivery in the information system in accordance with Article 165*f* of the Agriculture Act of 29 April 1998.

[6]The cantonal authorities shall reduce the number of livestock units of manure permitted per hectare if the pollutant-bearing capacity of the soil, the altitude and topographical conditions so require.

[7]The Federal Council may authorise exceptions to the requirements for agricultural land in cases of:


|    a. poultry and horse-stabling farms, as well as other already existing small or medium-sized animal husbandry farms;  
|    b. farms serving the public interest (waste recovery, research, etc.).

[8]One livestock unit of manure corresponds to the average annual production of liquid and solid manure by one cow weighing 600 kg.

The correct functioning of waste water treatment plants and processing plants for farm manure must be checked at regular intervals.

[2]The cantonal authorities shall ensure that such installations are inspected periodically.

[**Art. 16** Federal Council regulations on waste water treatment and the inspection of installations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_16) 

The Federal Council shall lay down the requirements for:


|    a. discharge into sewers;  
|    b. special releases from production processes;  
|    c. residues from waste water treatment plants, their recovery and disposal;  
|    d. the inspection of installations and equipment;  
|    e. the use of waste water issuing from the processing of farm manure.

### [Section 3 Technical Waste Water Requirements for the Granting of Building Permits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_3)

|    c. bear the cost, where applicable, of compensation paid in respect of limitations on property rights.

[**Art. 21** Groundwater protection areas](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_21) 

[1]The cantons shall determine areas which are of importance for the future use and recharge of groundwater resources. In such areas, no buildings or installations may be constructed, and no works shall be carried out which might adversely affect any future installation built to use or replenish the groundwater.

[2]The cantons may transfer responsibility for paying compensation in respect of limitations on property rights to persons subsequently responsible for groundwater wells and recharge installations.

### [Section 5 Handling Liquids which may pollute Water](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#tit_2/chap_1/sec_5)

## [Chapter 2 Ensuring appropriate Residual Flow](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#tit_2/chap_2)

[**Art. 29** Permits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_29) 

A permit is required by any person who, over and above normal public use:


|    a. withdraws water from a watercourse with permanent flow;  
|    b. withdraws water from lakes or groundwater resources in such a way as to affect substantially the discharge rate of a watercourse with permanent flow.

[**Art. 30** Conditions for the permit](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_30) 

Such withdrawal may be permitted provided that:


|    a. the requirements contained in Articles 31–35 are complied with;  
|    b. taken together with other withdrawals, the flow rate Q347 is reduced by at most 20 per cent and total withdrawal amounts to not more than 1,000 litres per second; or  
|    c. for the supply of drinking water, at most 80 litres per second from a spring and at most 100 litres per second from groundwater, based on the annual average, is withdrawn.

[**Art. 31** Minimum residual flow](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_31) 

[1]When withdrawal takes place from a permanently flowing watercourse, the minimum residual flow must be as follows:



| up to a flow rate Q347 of 60 l/s  | 50 l/s |  |
|     and for each further 10 l/s of flow rate Q347 | 8 l/s | , |
| for aflow rate Q347 of 160 l/s  | 130 l/s |  |
|     and for each further 10 l/s of flow rate Q347  | 4.4 l/s |  more, |
| for 500 l/s of flow rate Q347 | 280 l/s |  |
|     and for each further 100 l/s offlow rate Q347 | 31 l/s |  more, |
| for 2,500 l/sof flow rate Q347 | 900 l/s |  |
|     and for each further 100 l/s of flow rate Q347 | 21.3 l/s |  more, |
| for 10,000 l/s of flow rate Q347  | 2,500 l/s |  |
|     and for each further 1000 l/s of flow rate Q347  | 150 l/s |  more, |
| from 60,000 l/s of flow rate Q347 | 10,000 l/s | . |

[2]The minimum residual flow calculated according to paragraph 1 above shall be increased if the following requirements are not complied with and cannot be complied with as a result of other measures:


|    a. The prescribed water quality of the surface waters must be maintained in spite of the water withdrawal and existing waste water discharges.  
|    b. Groundwater resources must continue to be replenished such that the drinking water supply dependent on them remains available to the required extent and the water balance of soils used for agriculture is not substantially impaired.  
|    c. Rare habitats and biocoenoses which depend directly or indirectly on the type and size of a body of water must either be maintained or where possible be replaced by others of a similar value unless overriding reasons prevent this.  
|    d. The depth of water necessary for free fish migration must be maintained.  
|    e. In the case of watercourses with a flow rate Q347 of up to 40 litres per second below an altitude of 800 metres above sea level which serve as spawning grounds or habitats for juvenile fish, the continuation of these functions must be guaranteed.

[**Art. 32** Exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_32) 

The cantonal authorities may lay down lower minimum residual flow rates in the following circumstances:


|    a. if the flow rate Q347 of the body of water is lower than 50 l/s: over a 1,000 m long stretch below a point of withdrawal from a body of water situated at an altitude higher than 1,700 m above sea level or from a body of water not suitable as a habitat for fish and situated at an altitude between 1,500 and 1,700 m above sea level;  
|    b. in the case of water withdrawals from bodies of water not suitable as habitats for fish provided that the residual rate of flow represents at least 35 per cent of the flow rate Q347;  
|    b[bis]. on a 1000 m long stretch below a place of withdrawal in sections with negligible ecological potential, provided the natural functions of the body of water are not substantially impaired;  
|    c. in the framework of a protection and utilisation planning for a limited area forming a topographical whole, in so far as an appropriate balance can be achieved in the same area by specific measures such as refraining from further withdrawals; such protection and utilisation plan shall require the approval of the Federal Council;  
|    d. in cases of necessity, for withdrawals limited in time, in particular for the supply of drinking water, for fire-fighting or for agricultural irrigation.

[**Art. 33** Increase of the minimum residual flow](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_33) 

[1]The authorities shall increase the minimum residual flow to the extent which is deemed necessary after weighing up the interests for and against the planned water withdrawal.

[2]Interests in favour of a water withdrawal are as follows:


|    a. public interests which may be served by the water withdrawal;  
|    b. economic interests of the area in which the water originates;  
|    c. economic interests of those wishing to withdraw the water;  
|    d. energy supply which may be served by the water withdrawal.

[3]Interests against a water withdrawal are as follows:


|    a. the significance of the waters as an element of the landscape;  
|    b. the significance of the waters as a natural habitat and for the conservation of the diversity of the dependent fauna and flora, in particular of the fish fauna, the income derived from fishing and the natural reproduction of fish;  
|    c. maintaining a rate of flow sufficient to satisfy the quality requirements of waters in the long run;  
|    d. maintaining a balanced groundwater regimen which guarantees future supplies of drinking water, land use customary to the area and vegetation suited to the location;  
|    e. ensuring agricultural irrigation.

[4]Anyone wishing to withdraw water shall provide the authorities with a report on:


|    a. the consequences of the water withdrawal, calculated at various rates of flow, on the interests served by the withdrawal, with particular regard to the production of electric energy and its costs;  
|    b. the interests which are likely to be adversely affected by the water withdrawal and measures which might be taken to prevent such impairment.

[**Art. 34** Water withdrawal from lakes and groundwater resources](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_34) 

If water is withdrawn from lakes or groundwater resources and the rate of flow of watercourses is thereby substantially affected, the watercourses in question must be protected as provided for in Articles 31–33.

[**Art. 35** Decision of the authorities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_35) 

[1]The authorities shall decide in each individual case on the required water endowment and any other measures which may be necessary to protect waters below the point of withdrawal.

[2]They may specify temporally variable required water endowments. Residual flows shall not fall below those specified in Articles 31 and 32.

[3]The authorities shall consult the competent agencies before making their decision; in cases where the withdrawals in question concern hydropower plants with gross production in excess of 300 kW, they shall also consult the federal government.

[**Art. 39** Introduction of solid substances into lakes](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_39) 

[1]The introduction of solid substances into lakes is prohibited even in cases where these substances would not lead to pollution.

[2]The cantonal authorities may permit the creation of embankments:


|    a. for the construction of buildings in built-up areas which cannot be located elsewhere if an overriding public interest requires such an embankment and the purpose in view cannot be attained in any other way;  
|    b. if a shallow water zone may be thereby improved.

[3]The embankments created shall be as natural as possible, and all bank flora destroyed shall be replaced.

[**Art. 39***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_39_a) [Hydropeaking](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_39_a) 

[1] Those responsible for hydropower plants must prevent or eliminate by means of civil engineering measures short-term artificial changes in the water flow on a body of water (hydropeaking) that cause serious harm to the indigenous flora and fauna as well as their habitats. At the request of the person responsible for a hydropower plant, the authority may order operational instead of civil engineering measures.

[2] The measures are determined by:


|    a. the degree of harm caused to the body of water;  
|    b. the ecological potential of the body of water;  
|    c. the proportionality of the cost;  
|    d. the interests of flood protection;  
|    e. the energy policy goals relating to the promotion of renewable energy sources.

[3] Within the catchment area of the body of water concerned, the measures must be coordinated with each other after hearing the persons responsible for the hydropower plants concerned.

[4] Retention basins constructed in application of paragraph 1 may be used for pumped storage without modification of the licence.

[1]The person responsible for a dam shall as far as possible ensure that in flushing or emptying an impoundment or when inspecting drainage and flood overflow structures, downstream fauna and flora are not harmed.

[2]Flushing and emptying shall take place only with the authorisation of the cantonal authority. The licensing authority shall consult interested specialist agencies. If periodical flushing and emptying are required in order to maintain operational safety, the authority shall fix only the times and types of such operations.

[3]If a person responsible is obliged to lower the water level of a reservoir on safety grounds as a result of exceptional events, he shall immediately inform the responsible authority.

[**Art. 41** Flotsam at dams](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_41) 

[1]Anyone who dams up a watercourse may not put any flotsam which he may have removed for operational reasons back into the water. The authority may grant exceptions.

[2]The person responsible for a dam must periodically collect the flotsam near his installation according to the instructions of the authority.

[**Art. 42** Withdrawal and discharge of fresh water or used water](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_42) 

[1]If water is withdrawn from or discharged into a natural lake, the stratification and flow conditions in the lake may not be substantially modified, and no water-level fluctuations potentially harmful to the riparian zone may be allowed to occur.

[2]In the case of watercourses, the type and location of the discharge of fresh water or waste water must be selected in such a way that as little artificial reinforcement and correction as possible is required.

[**Art. 43** Conservation of groundwater resources](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_43) 

[1]The cantons shall ensure that over the long term no more water is withdrawn from ground­water resources than flows into them. In the short term, more water may be withdrawn unless this impairs the quality of groundwater or the vegetation.

[2]If a groundwater resource is impaired as a result of excessive withdrawal or through reduced recharge, the canton shall ensure that the situation is remedied as far as possible, either through reducing the rate of withdrawal or by artificial recharge or by underground storage of drinking water.

[3]Different groundwater resources may not be connected to each other on a permanent basis if such a connection may impair the quantity or quality of the groundwater.

[4]Storage volumes and flows of usable groundwater resources may not be substantially reduced on a permanent basis as a result of new installations of any kind.

[5]Low dams shall not substantially impair the groundwater nor the vegetation which depends on the groundwater level. The authority may grant exceptions for existing installations.

[6]Drainage of a zone which results in a lowering of the groundwater table over a large area shall be permitted only if agricultural utilisation cannot be ensured in any other way.

[**Art. 43***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_43_a) [Bed load budget](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1992/1860_1860_1860/en#art_43_a) 

[1] The bed load budget in the body of water may not be changed by installations to the extent that they cause serious harm to the indigenous flora and fauna, their habitats, the groundwater regimen and flood protection. The persons responsible for the installations shall take suitable measures to this end.

[2] The measures are determined by:


|    a. the degree of harm caused to the body of water;  
|    b. the ecological potential of the body of water;  
|    c. the proportionality of the cost;  
|    d. the interests of flood protection;  
|    e. the energy policy goals relating to the promotion of renewable energy sources.

[3] Within the catchment area of the body of water concerned, the measures must be coordinated with each other after hearing the persons responsible for the installations concerned.
