## [Chapter 1 Purpose, Scope and Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#tit_1/chap_1)

[**Art. 1** Purpose and scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_1) 

[1] For the protection of people and the environment against ionising radiation, this Ordinance regulates:


|    for planned exposure situations:   
|    licences,   
|    public exposure,   
|    unjustified activities,   
|    medical exposure,   
|    occupational exposure,   
|    handling of radiation sources,   
|    handling of radioactive waste,   
|    prevention and management of failures; 


|    for emergency exposure situations: preparedness and management;

|    training and continuing education of persons handling ionising radiation or radioactivity;   
|    supervision and enforcement;   
|    advisory activities of the Federal Commission for Radiological Protection (KSR). 

[2] It applies to all exposure situations for artificial and for natural ionising radiation.

[3]It does not apply to:


|    a. exposures to radionuclides naturally present in the human body;  
|    b. exposures to cosmic radiation; it does, however, apply to exposures of aircrew to cosmic radiation;  
|    c. aboveground exposures to radionuclides present in the undisturbed earth’s crust.

[**Art. 2** Definitions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_2) 

1 In this Ordinance:


|    *planned exposure situation* means an exposure situation which arises from the planned operation of a radiation source or from a human activity which alters exposure pathways, so as to cause the exposure or potential exposure of people or the environment;   
|     *emergency exposure situation* means an exposure situation due to an emergency, as defined in Article 132;  
|    c. *existing exposure situation* means an exposure situation that already exists when a decision on its control has to be taken and which does not call or no longer calls for urgent measures to be taken; this involves, in particular, radiological legacies, radon, naturally occurring radioactive material and long‑term contamination following an emergency;  
|    d. *occupational exposure* means exposure due to occupational activities; occupational exposure may involve employees, self-employed persons, apprentices and students;

|    2. handling thereof is not exempt from mandatory licensing and supervision under radiological protection or nuclear energy legislation;


|    q. *radioactive substance* is synonymous with *radioactive material*;  
|    r. *radioactive source* means radioactive material employed for the purpose of utilising its radioactivity;  
|    s. *sealed radioactive source* means a radioactive source whose structure is such as to prevent, under normal conditions of use, the release of radioactive substances and thus exclude the risk of contamination;  
|    t. *unsealed radioactive source* means a radioactive source that does not meet the requirements for a sealed radioactive source;  
|    u. *orphan radioactive material* means radioactive material that is no longer under the control of the owner or licence holder;

## [Chapter 2 Principles of Radiological Protection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#tit_1/chap_2)

[**Art. 3** Justification](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_3) 

An activity is justified within the meaning of Article 8 of the Radiological Protection Act (RPA) if:


|    a. the associated benefits clearly outweigh the radiation-related drawbacks; and  
|    b. overall, for people and the environment, no more favourable alternative is available involving no or lower radiation exposure.

[**Art. 4** Optimisation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_4) 

1 Radiological protection must be optimised for all exposure situations.

2 Optimisation involves reducing as far as possible and reasonable:


|    a. the likelihood of exposure;  
|    b. the number of people exposed;  
|    c. the individual dose to the persons exposed.

[**Art. 5** Dose limits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_5) 

For planned exposure situations, limits shall be specified which must not be exceeded by the sum of all radiation doses accumulated by a person in a calendar year (dose limit). For medical exposures, no such limits shall be specified.

[**Art. 6** Reference levels](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_6) 

1 If in existing exposure situations or in emergency exposure situations the dose limits cannot be complied with, or if in these situations compliance with the dose limits would involve disproportionate efforts or would be counterproductive, then reference levels shall be applied.

2 To ensure that the reference level can be complied with, the requisite measures must be taken.

[**Art. 7** Dose constraints](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_7) 

1 For planned exposure situations, the dose received by a person from a single radiation source or activity shall be specified (dose constraint). This dose constraint shall be specified for each radiation source in such a way that the sum of all doses received from the various radiation sources does not exceed the dose limit.

2 The licence holder shall specify the dose constraints for the occupationally exposed persons within the enterprise.

3 The licensing authority (Art. 11) shall decide whether source-related dose constraints are required for the public and shall specify these in the licence. If this has not been done in the case of activities already licensed, the supervisory authority (Art. 184) may specify source-related dose constraints.

4 Dose constraints are optimisation instruments. When defining dose constraints, the current state of science and technology must be taken into account.

5 If a dose constraint is exceeded, measures must be taken.

[**Art. 8** Risk-based graded approach](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_8) 

All radiological protection measures must be graduated according to the underlying risk.

|    a. in the *low-dose range* if the patient receives an effective dose of less than 1 mSv;  
|    b. in the *medium-dose range* if the patient receives an effective dose of between 1 mSv and 5 mSv;  
|    c. in the *high-dose range* if the patient receives an effective dose of more than 5 mSv.

### [Section 2 Medical Justification](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#tit_2/chap_4/sec_2)

[**Art. 27** Fundamental justification](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_27) 

Without prejudice to Articles 28 and 29, medical exposures are deemed to be fundamentally justified.

[**Art. 28** Justification of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#art_28) 

[1] Any general application of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures must be justified in advance.

For the RPO of 22 June 1994, the values for these radionuclides were taken from the National Radiological Protection Board report NRPB-R245 (1991).

[Sources: IAEA, Safety Standards: Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards, Revision of IAEA Safety Series No. 115, GOV/2011/42, 15 August 2011; Table I.2; Brenk Systemplanung, Berechnung von Freigrenzen and Freigabewerten für Nuklide, für die keine Werte in den IAEA-BSS vorliegen, Endbericht, Aachen, 2012.] For radionuclides with a short half-life, the exemption levels calculated in the report by Brenk Systemplanung are often higher than the exemption levels for specific activity which are specified for moderate amounts of material in the IAEA BSS. In such cases, and for the small number of radionuclides for which no value was calculated by Brenk Systemplanung, the values specified for moderate amounts of material in the IAEA BSS are used in this Ordinance [source: IAEA, Safety Standards: Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards, Revision of IAEA Safety Series No. 115, GOV/2011/42, 15 August 2011; Table I.1, Column «Activity concentration»]. Radionuclides for which the exemption levels given for moderate amounts of material in the IAEA BSS are used are marked [1] in Column 9 of the Table.  
|    Radionuclides for which the contribution of daughter nuclides was taken into account in determining the LL value are marked [2] in Column 9 of the Table. The Table below indicates, for each radionuclide for which a daughter nuclide was taken into account, the last radionuclide in the decay chain which was used together with the parent to calculate the LL value.   
|    Example: Ra-226 -> Po-214 means that the daughter nuclides of Ra-226 up to Po-214 (i.e. Rn-222, Po-218, Pb-214, Bi-214 and Po-214) were taken into account, together with the parent, in calculating the clearance level.   
|     For H-3 and S-35, which can occur in various chemical forms, the LL was calculated in the Brenk Systemplanung report using the more pessimistic dose coefficient for each exposure pathway (e.g. in the case of S-35, with *e*ing for S‑35 org. and *e*inh for S-35 inorg.). The LL values thus determined were applied to all chemical forms of the radionuclide.  
|    10 Licensing limit (LA). The licensing limit values are derived from Column 4 since inhalation is the main risk when radionuclides are handled in the laboratory. The inhalation of activity at the licensing limit on a single occasion yields a committed effective dose of 5 mSv.  
|     For inert gases, C-11, N-13, O-15, F-18 and Cl-38, the licensing limit corresponds to the activity in an enclosed space of 1000 m[3] and a CA concentration as specified in Column 11.  
|    11 Guidance value for chronic airborne activity for occupationally exposed persons (CA). Exposure to an airborne activity concentration CA for 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year yields a committed effective dose of 20 mSv.  
|     For inhalation: CA [Bq/m[3]] = 0.02 Sv / (*e*inh . 2400 m[3]/a).  
|     For inert gases, immersion in a semi-infinite hemispherical cloud for 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year yields an effective dose of 20 mSv. (The dose coefficients for immersion *e*imm are taken from ICRP Publication 119 if they are not covered by Guideline ENSI-G14.) In most cases, the CA value relates to the parent nuclide. The exceptional cases where the CA value is given for the daughter nuclide are indicated as such. Also indicated by a footnote are those cases where immersion leads to irradiation of the skin or all organs and where the dose resulting from immersion is greater than that from inhalation. [5]: In the case of Kr-88, values are given for the daughter nuclide for immersion. [3]: Derived from the effective dose for immersion. [4]: Derived from the skin dose for immersion. In this case, the dose coefficients *e*imm for the skin are taken from the publication: Federal Guidance Report No. 12, External exposure to radionuclides in air, water and soil, Keith F. Eckerman and Jeffrey C. Ryman, Sept. 1993.  
|    12 Guidance value for surface contamination outside of controlled areas, averaged over 100 cm2 (CS).  
|     The CS value is calculated on the basis of the following scenarios, with the most unfavourable being chosen:  
|    – chronic exposure throughout the year (8760 hours) resulting from skin contamination yields an equivalent dose of 50 mSv per year (1/10 of the dose limit for the skin);  
|    – daily ingestion of contamination on an area of 10 cm2 yields an effective dose of 0.5 mSv per year;  
|    – a single inhalation of 10% of the activity of contamination on an area of 100 cm2 yields a dose of 0.5 mSv (1/10 of the licensing limit);  
|    – a maximum value of 1000 Bq/cm2.


|    **13**  **Unstable daughter nuclide**  
|    13 Unstable daughter nuclide; → means: decays into …; in the case of branching, the different nuclides formed are separated by commas; a second arrow indicates a decay series. [6]: The *h*10 value of the daughter nuclide exceeds 0.1 (mSv/h)/GBq at a distance of 1 m (attention may need to be paid to the daughter nuclide!).

where *H*T or *w*R*D*T.R is the equivalent dose in a tissue or organ T and *w*T is the tissue weighting factor. The unit for the effective dose is the same as for absorbed dose, J/kg, and its special name is sievert (Sv).

#### [1.7 Tissue weighting factors](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_1/lvl_d4e339)

The sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors (*w*T), where is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and up to age 70 years for children.

#### [1.9 Dose equivalent, *H*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_1/lvl_d4e341)


|    1.9.1 The product of *D* and *Q* at a point in tissue, where *D* is the absorbed dose and *Q* is the quality factor for the specific radiation at this point, thus:

![](https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/20220101/en/html/image/image10.png)


|    1.9.2 The unit of dose equivalent is joule per kilogram (J/kg), and its special name is sievert (Sv). For the relevant operational quantities, see personal dose equivalent and ambient dose equivalent.

#### [1.10 Ambient dose](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_1/lvl_d4e342)

The dose equivalent measured at a specific location. The quantities ambient dose equivalent *H\**(10) and directional dose equivalent *H'*(*d*,Ω) are taken to be the ambient dose.

#### [1.11 Personal dose equivalent, *H*p(*d*)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_1/lvl_d4e343)


|    1.11.1 One dose equivalent: the dose equivalent in soft tissue (commonly interpreted as the «ICRU sphere») at an appropriate depth, *d* [mm], below a specified point on the human body, usually given by the position where the individual’s dosimeter is worn. The unit of personal dose equivalent is joule per kilogram (J/kg), and its special name is sievert (Sv).  
|    1.11.2 The personal dose equivalent *H*p(10) is used as an estimate of the effective dose. The personal dose equivalent *H*p(0.07) is used as an estimate of the dose to the skin and to the lens of the eye. Alternatively, the personal dose equivalent *H*p(3) may be used as an estimate of the dose to the lens of the eye.

#### [1.12 Directional dose equivalent, *H'*(*d,*Ω)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_1/lvl_d4e344)


|    1.12.1 The dose equivalent at a point in a radiation field that would be produced by the corresponding expanded field in the ICRU sphere at a depth, *d*, on a radius in a specified direction, Ω. The unit of directional dose equivalent is joule per kilogram (J/kg), and its special name is sievert (Sv).  
|    1.12.2 In the particular case of a unidirectional field, the direction can be specified in terms of the angle α between the radius opposing the incident field and the specified radius Ω. If α= 0°, the quantity *H'*(*d*, 0°) may be written as *H'*(*d*) and is equal to *H\**(*d*).  
|    1.12.3 The recommended values for *d* are 10 mm for penetrating radiation, 0.07 mm for low-penetrating radiation and 3 mm for the lens of the eye (see **operational quantities for area monitoring**).

#### [1.13 Ambient dose equivalent, *H\**(10)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_1/lvl_d4e345)

The dose equivalent at a point in a radiation field that would be produced by the corresponding expanded and aligned field in the ICRU sphere at a depth of 10 mm on the radius vector opposing the direction of the aligned field. The unit of ambient dose equivalent is joule per kilogram (J/kg), and its special name is sievert (Sv).

#### [1.14 ICRU sphere](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_1/lvl_d4e346)

A sphere of tissue-equivalent material, 30 cm in diameter, with a density of 1 g/cm3 and a mass composition of 76.2% oxygen, 11.1% carbon, 10.1% hydrogen and 2.6% nitrogen.

#### [1.15 Quality factor, *Q*(*L*)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_1/lvl_d4e347)


|    1.15.1 The factor characterising the biological effectiveness of a radiation, based on the ionisation density along the tracks of charged particles in tissue. *Q* is defined as a function of the unrestricted linear energy transfer, LET (*L* in keV/μm), of charged particles in water: 

![](https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/20220101/en/html/image/image11.png)


|    1.15.2 *Q* has been superseded by the radiation weighting factor, *w*R, in the definition of equivalent dose, but it is still used in calculating the operational dose equivalent quantities used in monitoring.

### [2 Method for determination of the radiation dose](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_2)

#### [2.1 Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_2/lvl_d4e349)

The effective dose and equivalent doses are generally determined using operational quantities.

#### [2.2 Operational quantities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_2/lvl_d4e351)


|    2.2.1 The operational quantities for individual monitoring of external exposure are:  
|    a. the personal dose equivalent *H*p(10), with the short form *H*p;  
|    b. the personal dose equivalent *H*p(0.07), with the short form *H*s;  
|    c. the personal dose equivalent *H*p(3).


|    2.2.2 The operational quantities for area monitoring are:  
|    a. the ambient dose equivalent *H\**(10);  
|    b. the directional dose equivalent *H'*(0.07);  
|    c. the directional dose equivalent *H'*(3).


|    2.2.3 The operational quantity for internal exposure is the committed effective dose *E*50, calculated using standard models and the dose coefficients specified in Annexes 3 and 6.

#### [2.3 Personal doses and ambient doses below the relevant dose limits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_2/lvl_d4e352)


|    2.3.1 In situations of external exposure, the equivalent dose for organs is taken to be equal to the personal dose equivalent *H*p(10), or to the ambient dose equivalent *H*\*(10), for all tissues and organs apart from the skin and the lens of the eye.  
|    2.3.2 In situations of external exposure, the equivalent dose for the skin, hands and feet is taken to be equal to the personal dose equivalent *H*p(0.07), or to the directional dose equivalent *H'*(0.07).  
|    2.3.3 In situations of external exposure, the equivalent dose for the lens of the eye is taken to be equal to the personal dose equivalent *H*p(0.07), or to the directional dose equivalent *H'*(0.07). Alternatively, it may also be taken to be equal to the personal dose equivalent *H*p(3), or to the directional dose equivalent *H'*(3).  
|    2.3.4 The effective dose is taken to be equal to the sum of:  
|    a. the personal dose equivalent *H*p(10), or the ambient dose equivalent *H\**(10); and  
|    b. the committed effective dose *E*50.



#### [2.4 Personal doses above the relevant dose limits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_2/lvl_d4e353)

If the dose values determined in accordance with point 2.3 are above the relevant limits, then the effective dose or equivalent doses for the person concerned must be individually determined by a radiological protection expert, in cooperation with the supervisory authority, using calculation methods and dose coefficients in accordance with the current state of science and technology. The value thus determined is decisive in establishing whether or not a dose limit has been exceeded.

#### [2.5 Area monitoring](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e330/lvl_2/lvl_d4e354)

Where ambient dose limits are specified by this Ordinance, the ambient dose is taken to be:


|    a. the quantity *H\**(10) (ambient dose equivalent) for penetrating radiation;   
|    b. the quantity *H'*(0.07) (directional dose equivalent) for low-penetrating radiation.

### [1 Immission limits for air (*LI*air):](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_7/lvl_d4e363/lvl_1)


|    1.1 The immission limits for air are defined in such a way that permanent residence (8766 hours per year = *PR*) at a location with an airborne activity concentration equal to the immission limit for a specific nuclide would lead, based on inhalation and immersion, to an annual dose of 0.3 mSv for the critical person: infant (eb), ten-year old child (e10) or adult (Ad).

![](https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/20220101/en/html/image/image12.png)


|    where *e*inh,eb, *e*inh,e10 and *e*inh,ad [mSv/Bq] are the inhalation dose coefficients for infants, ten-year-old children and adults, and *e**imm* [(mSv/h)/(Bq/m3)] is the immersion dose coefficient (non-age-dependent). The inhalation and immersion dose coefficients are taken from Annexes 5 and 6.   
|    For immersion, a shielding factor (*F*abs) of 0.4 is assumed for time spent indoors.   
|    For breathing rates for infants, ten-year-old children and adults (*DR*eb, *DR*e10 and *DR*ad [m3/a]), the following values (ENSI-G14) were used:   
|    a. *DR*eb = 2022 [m[3]/a]  
|    b. *DR*e10 = 5688 [m[3]/a]  
|    c. *DR*ad= 7584[m[3]/a]



### [2 Immission limits for waters (*LI*eaux):](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_7/lvl_d4e363/lvl_2)


|    2.1 The immission limits for publicly accessible waters are defined in such a way that the critical person entirely meeting their need for drinking water with water contaminated at a level corresponding to the immission limit would thus receive an annual ingestion dose of 0.3 mSv.

|    where *e*ing,eb, *e*ing,e10 and *e*ing,ad [mSv/Bq] are the ingestion dose coefficients for infants, ten-year-old children and adults, and *CoE*eb, *CoE*e10*,* and *CoE*ad are the drinking water consumption in litres per year [l/a] for infants, ten-year-old children and adults.   
|    For drinking water consumption, 650 l/a was assumed for adults and ten-year-old children, and 250 l/a for infants. The ingestion dose coefficients are taken from Annex 5. 

### [3 In the case of nuclide mixtures, the summation rule applies for the immission limits for air and for waters:](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_7/lvl_d4e363/lvl_3)

## [Zone types and area types](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2017/502/en#annex_10/lvl_d4e377)

1. Depending on the degree of contamination which is present or to be expected, zones shall be classified into the following zone types:



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zone type | Surface contamination *C*s | Airborne contamination *C*A |
| 0 | *C*S < 1[.]CS | *C*A < 0.05[.]CA |
| I | *C*C < 1[.]CS | 0.05[.]CA ≤ *C*A < 0.1[.]CA |
| II | 1.CS ≤ *C*S < 10.CS | 0.05.CA ≤ *C*A < 0.1.CA  |
| III | 10.CS ≤ *C*S < 100.CS | 0.1.CA ≤ *C*A < 10.CA |
| IV | *C*S ≥ 100.CS | *C*A ≥ 10.CA |
|  |  |  |

If the degrees of airborne and surface contamination do not call for the same zone type, the more restrictive factor shall be decisive.

2. Within zones where ambient dose rates are elevated, for the planning and regulation of individual doses, the following areas must be designated with maximum permissible ambient dose rates:



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Area type | Ambient dose rate *D* at accessible locations |
