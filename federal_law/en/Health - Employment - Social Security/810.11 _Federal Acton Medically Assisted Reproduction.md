# [Chapter 2 Techniques of Medically Assisted Reproduction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#chap_2)

## [Section 1 Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#chap_2/sec_1)

[**Art. 3** Well-being of the child](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_3) 

[1] Assisted reproductive techniques may be used only if the well-being of the child is ensured.

[2] They may only be used in couples:


|    a. where a basis for a parent-child relationship exists in accordance with Articles 252–263 of the Swiss Civil Code (CC) and  
|    b. who, on the basis of their age and personal circumstances, are likely to be able to care for and bring up the child until it reaches the age of majority.

[3] Only married couples may use donated sperm cells.

[4] Reproductive cells or impregnated ova may not be used after the death of the person from whom they were obtained. The foregoing does not apply to sperm cells from sperm donors.

[5] Impregnated ova and embryos in vitro may no longer be used following the death of any one oft he couple concerned.

[**Art. 4** Prohibited practices](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_4) 

Ovum and embryo donation and surrogate motherhood are prohibited.

[**Art. 5**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_5) [Authorisation requirements for reproductive techniques](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_5) 

Assisted reproductive techniques may be used only if:


|    a. the aim is to enable a couple to overcome infertility and other treatment methods have failed or offer no prospect of success; or  
|    b. there is no other way of avoiding the risk of transmitting a serious disease to the offspring.

[**Art. 5***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_5_a) [Analysis of the genetic material of reproductive cells and embryos in vitro and their selection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_5_a) 

[1] The analysis of the genetic material of reproductive cells and their selection to influence the sex or other characteristics of the child are only permitted in order to identify chromosomal properties that may inhibit the development capacity of the embryo to be created, or if there is no other way of avoiding the risk of transmitting a predisposition for a serious disease. Article 22 paragraph 4 is reserved.

[2] The analysis of the genetic material of embryos in vitro and their selection according to sex or according to other characteristics are only permitted if:


|    a. there is no other way of avoiding the risk of an embryo with a hereditary predisposition for a serious disease from implanting in the uterus;  
|    b. it is probable that the serious disease will occur before the age of 50;  
|    c. no effective or expedient therapy is available for combating the serious disease; and  
|    d. the couple have informed the physician in writing that they are not prepared to accept the risk in terms of letter a.

[3] They are also permitted in order to identify chromosomal properties that may inhibit the development capacity of the embryo.

[**Art. 5***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_5_b) [Consent of the couple](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_5_b) 

[1] Reproductive techniques may only be used if the couple concerned have given their written consent after being given sufficient information and counselling.. After three unsuccessful treatment cycles, renewed consent and a further period for reflection are required.

[2] The couple’s written consent is also required for the reactivation of preserved embryos and impregnated ova.

[3] If an assisted reproductive technique involves an increased risk of multiple pregnancy, the procedure may be carried out only if the couple are prepared to accept a multiple birth.

[**Art. 6** Information and counselling](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_6) 

[1] Before an assisted reproductive technique is used, the physician must adequately inform the couple about:


|    a. the various causes of infertility;  
|    b. the medical procedure, including the prospects of success and the risks involved;  
|    c. the risk of a multiple pregnancy;  
|    d. possible psychological and physical stresses; and  
|    e. the legal and financial aspects.

[2] In the counselling session, appropriate reference should also be made to alternative ways of living and other family-building options.

[3] There must be an appropriate period for reflection, generally lasting four weeks, between the counselling session and treatment. It must be pointed out that the couple may also seek independent advice.

[4] Psychological support must be offered before, during and after treatment.

[**Art. 6***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_6_a) [Additional duties to provide information and counselling](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_6_a) 

[1] Before reproductive techniques with the analysis of the genetic material of reproductive cells or embryos in vitro or with the selection of donor sperm cells to prevent the transmission of a serious disease are carried out, the physician shall, in addition to the provision of information and counselling in accordance with Article 6, ensure that the couple concerned receive non-directive, expert genetic counselling. In this connection, the couple must receive sufficient information on:


|    a. the frequency, significance and probability of contracting the disease and its potential symptoms;  
|    b. prophylactic and therapeutic measures that may be taken against the disease;  
|    c. ways of organising the life of a child that suffers from the disease;  
|    d. the informative value of and risk of error in the analysis of the genetic material;  
|    e. risks that reproductive techniques carry for offspring;  
|    f. associations for parents of children with disabilities, self-help groups and information and counselling centres in terms of Article 17 of the Federal Act of 8 October 2004 on Human Genetic Testing (HGTA).

[2] Counselling may only concern the individual and family situation of the couple concerned and not the interests of society as a whole.

[3] The physician carries out the selection of one or more embryos for transfer to the uterus following a further counselling session.

[4] The physician must keep records of the counselling sessions.

[**Art. 6***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_6_b) [Protection and disclosure of genetic data](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2000/554/en#art_6_b)
