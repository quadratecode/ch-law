[1] Any natural or legal person who is domiciled in Switzerland and makes devices available on the market in Switzerland or in a contracting state must, upon request, provide the authorities responsible for controls as part of market monitoring with the declaration of conformity.

[2] Any natural or legal person who is domiciled in Switzerland and places a device on the market in Switzerland or in a contracting state or puts a device into service in Switzerland or in a contracting state without placing it on the market must carry out and be able to produce documentary evidence of an evaluation of the device’s conformity with the general safety and performance requirements.

[3] The demonstration of compliance with the general safety and performance requirements must also include a clinical evaluation in accordance with Article 61 EU-MDR.

[1] In response to a justified application, Swissmedic may authorise the placing on the market and putting into service of a specific device the use of which is in the interests of public health or patient safety or health even though:


|    a. the relevant conformity assessment procedure according to Article 23 has not been carried out; or  
|    b. the language requirements in Article 16 paragraph 2 have not been met.

[2] Individual devices that have not undergone the relevant conformity assessment procedure may be placed on the market and used without authorisation from Swissmedic provided:


|    a. they serve to avert life-threatening conditions or to resolve the permanent impairment of a bodily function;  
|    b. no conforming device is available for this specific indication;

[3] For devices placed on the market exclusively within the armed forces or within the framework of their specific tasks, the Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA) may, in agreement with the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports, grant exemptions.

[**Art. 23** Procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/552/en#art_23) 

The conformity assessment procedure is governed by Articles 52 and 54 and by Annexes IX–XI to EU-MDR, taking account of the amendments to Article 52, paragraph 4, sub-paragraph 2 EU-MDR adopted by the European Commission by delegated act.

[**Art. 24** Involvement of a designated body](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/552/en#art_24) 

[1] When a designated body is involved, all the information necessary for the conformity assessment must be made available to it.

[2] Manufacturers must not apply to more than one designated body in Switzerland or a contracting state to conduct a conformity assessment procedure for the same product.

[3] Any natural or legal person who applies to a designated body must inform that body whether an application to a different designated body in Switzerland or a contracting state has been withdrawn before a decision was issued or rejected by a different designated body in Switzerland or a contracting state.

[4] If a manufacturer withdraws its application to have a conformity assessment procedure conducted before the designated body has issued its decision on the assessment, the designated body in question will notify Swissmedic and the other designated bodies.

[5] The information required in paragraph 4 must be supplied exclusively via Eudamed.

[6] Where a manufacturer voluntarily changes designated body, it must comply with the requirements of Article 58 EU-MDR.

[4] Certificates issued by bodies designated under EU law and domiciled in an EU or EEA state but not recognised by an international agreement are deemed equivalent to certificates issued by Swiss bodies if it can be credibly demonstrated that:


|    a. the conformity assessment procedures used meet Swiss requirements; and  
|    b. the certificates were issued by a body with an equivalent qualification to that required in Switzerland.

[**Art. 26** Validity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2020/552/en#art_26)
