## (WPO)

of 28 October 1998 (Status as of 1 January 2021) 

The Swiss Federal Council,

based on Articles 9, 14 paragraph 7, 16, 19 paragraph 1, 27 paragraph 2,   
36*a* paragraph 2, 46 paragraph 2, 47 paragraph 1 and 57 paragraph 4 of the Waters Protection Act of 24 January 1991 (WPA),

ordains:

# [Chapter 1 General Provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#chap_1)

[**Art. 1** Purpose and principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#art_1) 

[1] This Ordinance shall facilitate the protection of surface and underground waters from harmful effects and enable their sustainable use.

[2] For this purpose, all measures taken under this Ordinance must take account of the ecological goals for waters (Annex 1).

[**Art. 2** Scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#art_2) 

[1] This Ordinance regulates:


|    a. ecological goals for waters;  
|    b. requirements on water quality;  
|    c. disposal of waste water;  
|    d. disposal of sewage sludge;  
|    e. requirements for animal husbandry farms;  
|    f. protection of waters in terms of area planning;  
|    g. maintenance of appropriate residual flow;  
|    h. prevention and remediation of other harmful effects on waters;  
|    i. granting of federal contributions.

[2] The Ordinance applies to radioactive substances, insofar as such substances have biological effects resulting from their chemical characteristics. Insofar as these substances have biological effects resulting from radiation, the legislation on radiation protection and nuclear energy applies.

# [Chapter 2 Disposal of Waste Water](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#chap_2)

## [Section 1 Differentiation between Polluted and Non-Polluted Waste Water](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#chap_2/sec_1)


[**Art. 3**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#art_3) 

[1] The authorities shall assess whether waste water entering a body of water by way of discharge or infiltration is considered to be polluted or non-polluted, taking account of:


|    a. the type, the amount, the characteristics and the temporal occurrence of potential water pollutants substances in the waste water;  
|    b. the condition of the receiving waters.

[2] During infiltration of waste water, they shall also take account of whether: 


|    a. waste water can be polluted because of existing soil pollution or the unsaturated subsoil;  
|    b. waste water is sufficiently purified in the soil or in the unsaturated subsoil;  
|    c. guide values under the Ordinance of 1 July 1998 on the Pollution of Soil (SoilPO) can be maintained in the long term**,** excepting infiltration into a plant intended for this purpose**,** or onto roads next to embankments or grass verges.

[3] Precipitation water running off built-up or sealed surfaces is as a rule considered to be non-polluted waste water if it: 


|    a. originates from roof surfaces;  
|    b. originates from roads, paths and areas on which no substantial amounts of potential water pollutants are unloaded, processed and stored and if they are sufficiently purified by infiltration into the ground. In assessing whether amounts of substances are substantial, the risk of accidents must be taken into consideration;  
|    c. originates from track installations where there is a long-term guarantee that pesticides will not be used or if pesticides have been sufficiently retained and degraded by a biologically active layer of soil.

## [Section 2 Drainage Planning](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#chap_2/sec_2)

[**Art. 4** Regional drainage planning](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#art_4) 

[1] The cantons shall ensure that a regional drainage plan (RDP) is drawn up to guarantee appropriate waters protection in a limited, hydrologically-related area in which waters protection measures of the communes must be coordinated.

[2] The RDP determines in particular:


|    a. the locations of waste water treatment plants and areas which are to be joined to them;  
|    b. which and to what extent surface waters are suitable for the discharge of waste water, particularly that arising from precipitation;  
|    c. the waste water treatment plants for which requirements in respect of discharge of waste water must be stricter or supplemented.

[3] In drawing up the RDP, the authorities shall take account of spatial requirements of waters, flood protection and measures for waters protection other than waste water treatment.

[4] The RDP is mandatory for planning and establishing of waters protection measures in communes.

[5] It shall be accessible to the public.

[**Art. 5** Communal drainage planning](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#art_5) 

[1] The cantons shall ensure that general drainage plans (GDP) are drawn up which guarantee adequate waters protection in communes and effective drainage of housing areas.

[2] The GDP shall specify as a minimum:


|    a. waste water treatment areas that must be served by public sewers;  
|    b. areas in which precipitation water running off built-up or sealed surfaces must be disposed of separately from other waste water;  
|    c. areas in which non-polluted waste water must be allowed to infiltrate;  
|    d. areas in which non-polluted waste water must be discharged into surfacewaters;  
|    e. measures by which non-polluted waste water with permanent flow must be kept away from waste water treatment plants;  
|    f. the locations where waste water treatment plantsmust be set up, and withwhich treatment system and with what capacity;   
|    g. areas in which systems other than waste water treatment plants must be used, and how, in these areas, waste water is to be disposed of.

[3] The GDP shall be adjusted if necessary:


|    a. to take account of developments in housing areas;  
|    b. if a RDP is drawn up or changed.

[4] It shall be accessible to the public.

## [Section 3 Discharge of Polluted Waste Water](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#chap_2/sec_3)

[**Art. 6** Discharge into waters](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#art_6) 

[1] The authorities shall authorise the discharge of polluted waste water into surfacewaters, drainage areas, underground rivers and streams if the requirements on discharge into waters according to Annex 3 are complied with.

[2] They shall set additional or stricter requirements, if:


|    a. the waters concerned by the discharge of waste water do not fulfil water quality requirements according to Annex 2 or if this is necessary to comply with international agreements or decisions; and  
|    b. on the basis of investigation (Art. 47) it is certain that deficient water quality is largely due to discharge of waste water, and procedures necessary to comply are not disproportionate for the waste water treatment plant.

[3] They may set additional or stricter requirements if the water quality according to Annex 2 is not sufficient for a specific use of the body of water concerned.

[4] They may apply less stringent requirements if:


|    a. by reducing the amounts of waste water discharged, fewer potential water pollutants are discharged even though the concentrations allowed are higher; or  
|    b. the environment as a whole is less impaired by the discharge of non-recyclable substances in industrial waste water than by another method of disposal; requirements on water quality according to Annex 2 and international agreements or decisions must be complied with.

[**Art. 7** Discharge into public sewers](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#art_7) 

[1] The authorities shall authorise discharge of waste water from industry according to Annex 3.2 or of other waste water according to Annex 3.3 into public sewers if the requirements of the relevant Annex are complied with.

[2] They shall set additional or stricter requirementsif by discharge of waste water:


|    a. operation of public sewers may be restrict or disrupted;   
|    b. in the case of waste water from the central waste water treatment plant, the requirements on discharge into a body of water are not met or may only be met by disproportionate measures, or could restrict or disrupt the operation of the plant in another way; or  
|    c. ...  
|    d. the operation of the plant in which sludge is incinerated may restricted or disrupted.

[3] They may apply less stringent requirements if:


|    a. by reducing the amounts of waste water discharged, fewer potential water pollutants are discharged even though the concentrations allowed are higher; or  
|    b. the environment as a whole will be less impaired by the discharge of non-recyclable substances in industrial waste water than by another disposal method**,** and in the case of waste water from the central waste water treatment plant**,** requirements on discharge into a body of water are met; or  
|    c. this is appropriate for the operation of the waste water treatment plant.

[**Art. 8** Infiltration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#art_8) 

[1] The infiltration of polluted waste water is prohibited.

[2] The authorities may authorise the infiltration of communal waste water or of other polluted waste water of comparable composition, if:


|    a. the waste water has been treated and meets the requirements for discharge into waters;  
|    b. in the case of the groundwater concerned, water quality requirements according to Annex 2 are met after infiltration of the waste water;  
|    c. infiltration ensues at an installation intended for the purpose, the directives of the SoilPO are not exceeded even in the long term, or in the absence of directives soil fertility is also guaranteed in the long term; and  
|    d. requirements valid for waste water treatment plants which discharge waste water into a body of water are met (Arts. 13–17).

[1] Polluted waste water occurring outside public sewers for which neither discharge into waters, nor infiltration, nor use combined with farm manure (Art. 12 para. 4 WPA) is permitted must be collected in a cesspit which is regularly emptied with its contents being transferred to a central waste water treatment plant or facility for special treatment. 

[2] Waste water from processing farm manure, hydroponics and other horticultural methods must be used in an environmentally compatible manner and reused agriculturally or horticulturally according to the state of the art.

[3] Waste water from mobile sanitation facilities must be collected and may be discharged into public sewers only by using equipment intended for this purpose. Excluded from this are sanitation facilities in:


|    a. railway carriages with their own waste water treatment facilities;  
|    b. railway carriages for long-distance traffic which were commissioned before 1 January 1 1997;  
|    c. railway carriages for regional or urban traffic which were commissioned before 1 January 2000.

[1] The water quality must be such that:


|    a. no visible iron sulphide patches form in the channel bed, unless due to particular natural conditions;  
|    b. nitrite and ammonia concentrations do not interfere with the reproduction development and health of sensitive organisms, such as salmonidae.

[2] The oxygen content on the channel bed must not be adversely affected by:


|    a. increased oxygen consumption due to an unnatural excess of oxidisable substances;  
|    b. a reduced permeability of the bottom resulting from unnaturally high sedimentation of fine particles (clogging) or artificial sealing.

[3] The hydrodynamics, morphology and temperature conditions of the water must not be so changed by water withdrawals, water discharges and building activities that its self-purification capacity is reduced or the water quality in the body of water is made insufficient to sustain communities specific to it.

[4] The introduction or the withdrawal of heat must not alter the temperature in a watercourse by more than 3 °C above or below the temperature in its as near natural as possible state, or, in trout water stretches, by more than 1.5 °C; furthermore, the water temperature must not exceed 25C°. These requirements apply after thorough mixing.

[5] The following numerical requirements apply to every water flow after thorough mixing of the waste water discharged into the receiving waters; a reserve may be made for particular natural conditions such as water discharge from mires, rare high-water peaks or rare low-water events.

[1] The morphology and functions of the upper layers of sediments which are essential for providing the water quality required to preserve the communities of plants, animals and micro-organisms must not be durably altered by changes made to the terrain (e.g. dredging, movement of excavated material within the expanse of water, levelling or backfilling of banks, reinforcement of banks or creation of dikes).

[2] The nutrient content should allow at most an average production of biomass; subject to particular natural circumstances.

[3] For lakes, moreover, the following applies:


|    a. the regulation of the lake waters, the discharge and extraction of water, the use of water for cooling and for the extraction of heat, should not alter the natural regime of temperatures or the distribution of nutrients within the expanse of water, nor should it disrupt conditions for living and reproduction of organisms, particularly in the riparian zone;  
|    b. the oxygen content of the water should at no time and at no lake depth amount to less than 4 mg/l O2; in addition, it must be sufficient for sensitive animals such as worms to be able to inhabit the lake bottom throughout the year and in numbers as close as possible to natural abundance, subject to particular natural conditions.

[1] The concentration of substances in the groundwater for which requirements are specified in No 22 should not continually increase.[]

[2] The quality of the groundwater must be such that it does not pollute surface water after exfiltration.

[3] The introduction or withdrawal of heat must not alter the temperature of the groundwater by more than 3 °C above or below the temperature in its natural state; this does not apply to very local changes in temperature.

[4] Infiltration of waste water into underground waters must not result in:


|    a. any disturbing change in the odour of the water;  
|    b. any lack of oxygen or unfavourable pH values;  
|    c. any turbidity or discoloration, except in the case of consolidated rock groundwater.

[5] Infiltration installations, withdrawals of water and other interventions connected with construction work must not, insofar as possible, damage the protective upper confining bed, or alter the hydrodynamics in such a way as to have detrimental effects on the quality of water.

#### [22 Additional requirements for groundwater which is used for drinking water or is intended as such](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#annex_2/lvl_d4e133/lvl_2/lvl_22)

[1] The water quality must be suchthat after the use of basic water conditioning, it complies with the requirements of the foodstuffs legislation.

[2] The following numerical requirements apply, subject to the particular natural circumstances. For substances originating from polluted sites, these requirements do not apply in the downstream area where the greater part of these substances is degraded or retained.

[1] Industrial waste water includes:


|    a. waste water from industrial plants;  
|    b. comparable waste water, such as that from laboratories and hospitals.

[2] Any person who discharges industrial waste water must, during production processes and waste water treatment take the require stat-of-the-art measures to avoid polluting waters. In particular, he or she must ensure that:


|    a. as little waste water is generated and as few potential water pollutants are discharged as is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable;  
|    b. unpolluted waste water and cooling water are separated from polluted waste water;  
|    c. polluted waste water is neither diluted nor mixed with other waste water in order to comply with the requirements; dilution or mixing is permitted if this is appropriate for the treatment of the waste water and as a result no more potential water pollutants are discharged than would be the case if the waste waters were treated separately.

[3] At the site of discharge, when discharging waste water into waters or public sewers they must comply with:


|    a. the general requirements in accordance with No 2; and  
|    b. the special requirements for specific substances in accordance with No 3 for waste water from certain industrial sectors. 

[4] If the person responsible for the concern can prove that he or she has taken the required state-of-the-art measures mentioned in paragraph 2, and that compliance with the general requirements specified in No 2 would be disproportionate, the authorities shall specify less stringent values.

[5] If the required state-of-the-art measures mentioned in paragraph 2 make it possible to comply with more stringent requirements than those specified in Nos 2 and 3, the authorities shall apply more stringent values based on the information received from the person responsible for the concern and after having heard this person.

[6] If Nos 2 and 3 contain no requirements for specific potential water pollutants, the authorities shall specify the necessary requirements based on the state of the art in the authorisation. In so doing they shall take account of international or national standards, directives published by the FOEN or standards drawn up by the industrial sector concerned in collaboration the FOEN.

[7] If industrial waste water also containing communal waste water (Annex 3.1) or other polluted waste water (Annex 3.3) is discharged into a body of water, the authorities shall specify the requirements in the authorisation in such a way that no more potential water pollutants are discharged with the waste water than would be the case if the different waste waters were treated separately in compliance with the requirements of the corresponding Annexes.

[1] The water protection area Au comprises the exploitable underground waters as well as the marginal areas necessary for their protection.

[2] An underground body of water is exploitable or suitable for procurement of water if the water in its natural or enriched state:


|    a. is available in sufficient quantity to be exploitable, demand not being taken into account; and  
|    b. complies with the requirements of the foodstuff legislation for drinking water, if necessary after basic treatment.

##### [112 Water protection area Ao](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e180/lvl_1/lvl_11/lvl_112)

The water protection area Ao comprises the surface waters and their riparian zone, as far as these are required for guaranteeing special use.

|    b. the groundwater well inflow being obstructed by underground installations.

[2] In the case of unconsolidated sediment and weakly heterogeneous karst and fissured-rock aquifers, it should also prevent pathogens and substances that may pollute water from entering the groundwater well in such quantities that there is a risk to sources of drinking water.

[3] They shall be separated around groundwater wells or recharge installations and shall be dimensioned in such a way that:


|    a. the distance from Zone S1 to the outer border of Zone S2 shall amount to at least 100 m in the upstream direction; it may be less if hydrogeological investigations prove that the groundwater well or recharge installation are equally well protected by intact and relatively impermeable cover layers; and  
|    b. in the case of unconsolidated sediment and weakly heterogeneous karst and fissured-rock aquifers the flow duration of the groundwater from the outer border of Zone S2 to the groundwater well or the recharge installation will be at least ten days.

##### [124 Zone S3](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e180/lvl_1/lvl_12/lvl_124)

[1] Zone S3 is intended to guarantee that in the case of imminent dangers (e.g. accidents with substances which may pollute water) enough space and time is available for the necessary measures.

[2] The distance from the outer border of Zone S2 to the outer border of Zone S3 is as a rule at least as great as the distance from zone 1 to the outer border of Zone S2.

##### [125 Zones Sh and Sm](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e180/lvl_1/lvl_12/lvl_125)

[1] Zones Sh and Sm are intended to prevent:


|    a. groundwater from being polluted by the construction and operation of installations and output of substances; and  
|    b. the hydrodynamics of the groundwater being adversely affected by building activities.

[2] Zone Sh includes areas of high vulnerability in the catchment area of a groundwater well. 

[3] Zone Sm includes areas of at least moderate vulnerability in the catchment area of a groundwater well. 

[4] The vulnerability is determined on the basis of the properties of the covering (soil and protective layer) and of the karst or fissured rock system and the infiltration conditions.

#### [13 Groundwater protection area](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e180/lvl_1/lvl_13)

Groundwater protection areas are demarcated in such a way as to enable the locations of the groundwater wells and recharge installations to be determined appropriately and to demarcate the groundwater protection zones accordingly.

### [2 Measures for the protection of waters](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e180/lvl_2)

#### [21 Protection of areas particularly at risk](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2863_2863_2863/en#annex_4/lvl_d4e180/lvl_2/lvl_21)

[1] In the water protection areas Au and Ao, no installations may be constructed that constitute a special risk to a body of water; in particular, the construction of storage tanks with more than 250 000 l usable volume and containing liquids that may pollute waters already in small quantities is not permitted. The authority may permit exceptions for good cause.

[2] In water protection area Au,, no installations may be constructed which lie below the average groundwater level. The authorities may grant exemptions where the flow-through capacity of the groundwater is reduced by a maximum of 10 per cent when compared with its state when uninfluenced by the plant in question.

[3] For the excavation of gravel, sand and other material in water protection area Au:


|    a. a protective layer of material must be left that is at least 2 m above the highest maximum ten-year groundwater level; in the case of a recharge installation, the actual level of the water table applies if it is higher than the maximum ten-year high;  
|    b. the excavation area shall be limited in such a way that natural groundwater recharge is guaranteed;  
|    c. after excavation, the soil shall be restored so that it offers the same protection as in its original state.
